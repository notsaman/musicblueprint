0,Guns n’ Roses,Civil War,"What we've got here is failure to communicate Some men, you just can't reach So, you get what we had here, last week Which is the way he wants it Well, he gets it *Whistling* And I don't like it any more than you men  Look at your young men fighting Look at your women crying Look at your young men dying The way they've always done before Look at the hate we're breeding Look at the fear we're feeding Look at the lives we're leading The way we've always done before  My hands are tied The billions shift from side to side An' the wars go on with brainwashed pride For the love of God and our human rights An' all these things are swept aside By bloody hands, time can't deny An' are washed away by your genocide An' history hides the lies of our civil wars   D'you wear a black armband when they shot the man Who said peace could last forever? An' in my first memories, they shot Kennedy I went numb when I learned to see So I never fell for Vietnam We got the wall in D.C. to remind us all That you can't trust freedom when it's not in your hands When everybody's fightin' for their promised land  And I don't need your civil war It feeds the rich, while it buries the poor Your power hungry, sellin' soldiers in a human grocery store Ain't that fresh? I don't need your civil war Ooh, no, no, no, no, no, no  Look at the shoes you're filling Look at the blood we're spilling Look at the world we're killing The way we've always done before Look in the doubt we've wallowed Look at the leaders we've followed Look at the lies we've swallowed An' I don't want to hear no more  My hands are tied For all, I've seen has changed my mind But still, the wars go on, as the years go by With no love of God or human rights An' all these dreams are swept aside By bloody hands of the hypnotized Who carry the cross of homicide And history bears the scars of our civil wars   We practice selective annihilation Of mayors and government officials For example, to create a vacuum Then we fill that vacuum As popular war advances Peace is closer  I don't need your civil war It feeds the rich, while it buries the poor Your power hungry, sellin' soldiers in a human grocery store Ain't that fresh? I don't need your civil war No no no no no no no no no no no no I don't need your civil war I don't need your civil war Your power hungry, sellin' soldiers in a human grocery store Ain't that fresh? I don't need your civil war No no no no no no no no no no, no, no I don't need one more war Ooh, I don't need one more war No no no, no woah, no woah  What's so civil 'bout war anyway?"

2,Frank Zappa,Camarillo Brillo,"She had that Camarillo brillo Flamin' out along her head I mean her Mendocino bean-o By where some bugs had made it red She ruled the Toads of the Short Forest And every newt in Idaho And every cricket who had chorused By the bush in Buffalo She said she was A Magic Mama And she could throw a mean Tarot And carried on without a comma That she was someone I should know She had a snake for a pet And an amulet And she was breeding a dwarf But she wasn't done yet She had gray-green skin A doll with a pin I told her she was awright But I couldn't come in (I couldn't come in right then . . . ) And so she wandered Through the door-way Just like a shadow from the tomb She said her stereo was four-way An' I'd just love it in her room Well, I was born To have adventure So I just followed up the steps Right past her fuming incense stencher To where she hung her castanets She stripped away Her rancid poncho An' laid out naked by the door We did it till we were un-concho An' it was useless any more She had a snake for a pet And an amulet And she was breeding a dwarf But she wasn't done yet She had gray-green skin A doll with a pin I told her she was awright But I couldn't come in (actually, I was very busy then) And so she wandered Through the door-way Just like a shadow from the tomb She said her stereo was four-way An' I'd just love it in her room Well, I was born To have adventure So I just followed up the steps Right past her fuming incense stencher To where she hung her castanets She said she was A Magic Mama And she could throw a mean Tarot And carried on without a comma That she was someone I should know (Is that a real poncho . . . I mean Is that a Mexican poncho or is that a Sears poncho? Hmmm . . . no foolin' . . . )"

5,Bruce Springsteen,Hungry Heart,"Got a wife and kids in Baltimore, Jack I went out for a ride and I never went back Like a river that don't know where it's flowing I took a wrong turn and I just kept going  Everybody's got a hungry heart Everybody's got a hungry heart Lay down your money and you play your part Everybody's got a hungry heart  I met her in a Kingstown bar We fell in love I knew it had to end We took what we had and we ripped it apart Now here I am down in Kingstown again  Everybody's got a hungry heart Everybody's got a hungry heart Lay down your money and you play your part Everybody's got a hungry heart  Everybody needs a place to rest Everybody wants to have a home Don't make no difference what nobody says Ain't nobody like to be alone  Everybody's got a hungry heart Everybody's got a hungry heart Lay down your money and you play your part Everybody's got a hungry heart"

9,Simon and Garfunkel,Bridge Over Troubled Water,"When you're weary Feeling small When tears are in your eyes I will dry them all I'm on your side When times get rough And friends just can't be found  Like a bridge over troubled water I will lay me down Like a bridge over troubled water I will lay me down  When you're down and out When you're on the street When evening falls so hard I will comfort you I'll take your part When darkness comes And pain is all around  Like a bridge over troubled water I will lay me down Like a bridge over troubled water I will lay me down  Sail on Silver Girl Sail on by Your time has come to shine All your dreams are on their way See how they shine, oh If you need a friend I'm sailing right behind  Like a bridge over troubled water I will ease your mind Like a bridge over troubled water I will ease your mind"
10,Frank Zappa,Joe's Garage,"A boring old garage in a residential area with a teen-age band rehearsing in it. JOE (the main character in the CENTRAL SCRUTINIZER'S Special Presentation) sings to us of the trials and tribulations of garage-band husbandry...  We take you now, to a garage, in Canoga Park... (It makes its own sauce...)  It wasn't very large There was just enough room to cram the drums In the corner over by the Dodge It was a fifty-four With a mashed up door And a cheesy little amp With a sign on the front said ""Fender Champ"" And a second hand guitar It was a Stratocaster with a whammy bar  At this point, LARRY (a guy who will eventually give up music and earn a respectable living as a roadie for a group called Toad-O) joins in the song...  We could jam in Joe's Garage His mama was screamin' His dad was mad We was playin' the same old song In the afternoon 'n' sometimes we would Play it all night long It was all we knew, 'n' easy too So we wouldn't get it wrong All we did was bend the string like...  Hey! Down in Joe's Garage We didn't have no dope or LSD But a coupla quarts'a beer Would fix it so the intonation Would not offend your ear And the same old chords goin' over 'n' over Became a symphony We would play it again 'n' again 'n' again Cause it sounded good to me One more time!  We could jam in Joe's Garage His mama was screaming ""Turn it down!"" We was playing' the same old song In the afternoon 'n' sometimes we would Play it all night long It was all we knew, and easy too So we wouldn't get it wrong Even if you played it on the saxophone  We thought we was pretty good We talked about keepin' the band together 'N' we figured that we should Cause about this time we was gettin' the eye From the girls in the neighborhood They'd all come over 'n' dance around Like... (Twenty teen-age girls dash In and go STOMP-CLAP STOMP-CLAP-CLAP...) So we picked out a stupid name Had some cards printed up for a couple 'a bucks 'N' we was on our way to fame Got matching suits 'N' Beatle Boots 'N' a sign on the back of the car 'N' we was ready to work in a Go-Go bar  One, two, three, four Let's see if you got some more!

25,The Drifters,There Goes My Baby - Rerecorded,"""The schools in a portion of Boston stretching from just south of South Boston through Roxbury and into Dorchester are districted with a similar effect: the predominantly black areas are cut away from the predominantly white areas."" Morgan v. Hennigan, U.S. District Court for Massachusetts, 1974 THE SEEK BUTTON on the Ford's radio is working. The downtown recedes. Miles of neighborhoods fill the windshield. The SEEK function locks on someplace in stereo, college FM probably. ""Yeah,"" a new friend says, ""Whas up. Whas goin on."" The radio has another button, VOL, which gets jacked repeatedly while the Ford hurtles, happily, to the source of the noise. Not to the station's broadcast booth on a campus across the river, nor to its transmission towers in the suburbs, but rather to RJam Productions in North Dorchester, where black kids from Boston's now-integrated high schools-Latin, Madison Park, Jeremiah Burke, Mattapan-cut demos and dream of being bigger than even the radio's new friend, a young man named Schoolly D who right now, at speaker-damaging volume, sounds darn big. ""Before we start this next record…,"" Schooly's saying. The record in question is called ""Signifying Rapper,"" a brief, bloody tale of ghetto retribution from Side 2 of Schoolly's Smoke Some Kill. The black areas are cut away from the white areas a federal judge ruled in '74, and evidence is everywhere that nothing's changed since then. On the southbound left of the Fitzgerald Expressway pass 20 blocks of grim Irish-Catholic housing projects, the western border of Belfast, complete with Sinn Fein graffiti and murals depicting a glorious United Ireland, a neighborhood where the gadfly will get his fibula busted for praising the '74 court order that bused ""Them"" from wherever it is ""They"" live-the Third World fer crissakes--into 97-percent-white South Boston. On the Expressway's right is the place the fibula-busters are talking about: the simultaneous northern border of Haiti, Jamaica and Georgia; a territory that maps of Boston call North Dorchester. Uniting the two sides of the Expressway is just about nothing. Both neighborhoods are tough and poor. Both hate the college world across the river, which, because of Boston's rotten public schools, they will never see as freshmen. And kids from both neighborhoods can do this hating to the beat of undergraduate radio, which this fine morning features suburban kids with student debt broadcasting the art of a ghetto Philadelphian roughly their age, once much poorer than they, but now, on royalties from Smoke Some Kill, very much richer. Not that the shared digging of black street music is news, or even new: twenty years ago, when Morgan v. Hennigan, Boston's own Brown v. Board of Education, was inching through the courts, and even dark-complected Italians were sometimes unwelcome in the Irish precincts east of the Expressway, kids in Boston's Little Belfast sang along with James Brown over the radio. ""Say it loud I'm black and I'm proud Say it loud I'm black and I'm proud!"" Except that halfway through the infectious funk, the crewcuts realize what they're saying: Jesus christ, ""I'm proud to be black"" fer chrissakes, like when you're in the porno store, you know, and you get lost or something and you find yourself in the men's part, you know? not the part for men in the part that's about men, Jesus, and you get the hell outta there. And so they hum/mumble the suppressed parts. ""Say it loud I'm mmm hum proud Say it loud Mum hum hum proud!"" But rap isn't funk, rock or jazz, and the vast crossover move, broadcasting ""ghetto"" music over college radios to ghettos of a different color, is no simple reenactment of past crossovers. How, for example, does the sing-along fan of Smoke Some Kill mumble his way through these lines: ""Black is beautiful Brown is sick? slick? stiff? Yellow's OK But white ain't shit."" Rjam Productions, modestly headquartered in a mixed black/Hispanic Field, Corner section of North Dorchester, is as follows: * One (1) four-car garage fitted with dubbing and remastering gear worth more than most of the rest of the real estate on the block; * One (1) touch-tone telephone (leased); * Two (2) Chevy Blazers, vanity-plated RJAM1 and RJAM2, each equipped with cellular phones and slick tape decks (also leased); * One (1) VCR with Kathleen Turner's Body Heat cued up on the morning in question; * Most importantly, eight (8) promising acts under binding contract If, as has happened to many local labels, Rjam were liquidated to satisfy creditors, these would be the pieces. But there are stores of value in the converted garage beyond the reach of the auctioneer's gavel. Schoolly D, the original Signifying Rapper, looms irresistibly from the pages of rap ""fanzines"" Hip-Hop and The Source; and Rjam's prime, unauctionable asset is the consuming ambition of the artists in its stable to be the next Schoolly D. Or the next Ice T, or Kool Moe Dee, or L. L. Cool J., or whoever's the special hero of the kid cutting the demo. On this particular morning, the dream is to be the next MC Lyte--a hard-rapping woman known for jams like ""MC Lyte vs. Vanna Whyte"" and ""10% Dis""--since today is Tam-Tam's day and Tam-Tam is, at 16, a tough girl in the MC Lyte mold who, like MC Lyte, can dance, look good, and tell men to beat it, all at once. Or so claims Tam-Tam's producer, promoter, and dutch uncle, Gary Smith, who opened RJam on Martin Luther King's birthday, '89, with his older brother Nate. Nate, the elder statesman, is 25. Gary, 22, runs the company while Nate travels with his boyhood-friend-turned-boss, quadruple-platinum, Prince-derived rapper/singer, Bobby Brown. RJam was founded in part with an investment from the 23-year-old multi-millionaire Brown, a native of Roxbury. Brown now lives in Los Angeles. Nate and Gary Smith turn a healthy profit making demos at $500/tape, but the brothers aren't in the health business. Their aim: to follow in the corporate footsteps of Def Jam, a once similarly tiny production company run from a basement in Hollis, Queens, which since its basement days, has given America Public Enemy, L. L. Cool J., the Beastie Boys, and much of the rest of that culture-quake called rap. Gary Smith doesn't compare RJam to Def Jam, and, unlike Def Jam's Russell Simmons, Gary produces pop, soul, and R&B as well as straight rap, and actually prefers R&B. But how many sophomores at nearby Jeremiah Burke can afford to dream in R&B, to front music lessons and $500 for an nth-hand sound set-up, find three friends to learn drums, bass and keyboards, and then raise another $500 to make a demo at RJam? Anybody with a larynx can rap, however, and Rjam's brisk business in rap demos pays the taxman, Boston Edison and the Chevrolet Motor Credit Corp. Twenty minutes farther south on the Fitzgerald Expressway, across the Neponset River and into the pricey suburbs, is the scene of John Cheever's boyhood, more recently celebrated as Massachusetts Miracle country, where technology ventures are started at the rate of five per week, four of which will fail within 12 months. RJam's Gary Smith is secret brother to the men of the suburban Chambers of Commerce, sharing their worries about cash flow, overhead, and the enforceability of his contracts; but Gary's world and theirs are as far apart as those of Ward and Eldridge Cleaver. Worriers in suburbia fear that ballooning property values will hike taxes on computer executives' seaside homes. In Gary's neighborhood, property values are actually falling. Waiting less than patiently for Tam-Tam, Gary honks twice. A tall, grave girl with an angel's heart-shaped face crosses the ghetto street and climbs into the back seat of RJAM1. She has, apparently, at least two voices, the cynical, sexy rant heard on tape this morning telling Pebbles men ain't worth it, and the whisper in which she now says hello. As RJAM1 re-crosses North Dorchester, heading back to the soundproof studios to get the day's work started, Gary and DJ Reese hash out production details. Tam-Tam's a dignified island in the back seat, and a shiver accompanies the thought that this could be the Motor City in '63 with Berry Gordy and an eighty-pound teenage Diana Ross, just voted Best Dressed at Cass Technical High School, driving crosstown to record a little number called ""Where Did Our Love Go."" Ask Tam-Tam about Diana Ross, and she gives a beatific smile. She's 16; she can remember only with difficulty the first rap she ever listened to, when rap was new and she was 8; Run-DMC or somebody, she mumbles in response to what suddenly seems a foolish question about her influences. Like most of rap's black audience (as distinct from rap's white audience, which is usually a decade older), Tam-Tam has no first-hand recollection of James Brown except as a source for rap. She is too young to have attended segregated schools. She was in diapers during the violent first few months of desegregation in Boston and can't remember the awful day in '74 when ""pro-neighborhood"" marchers from Irish South Boston came upon a black pedestrian at City Hall and beat him with pole-mounted American flags. Tam-Tam has star presence, and like many who do, she seems to see very little of what goes on around her, the price of the star's intense focus on self. She reminds you of Senator Gary Hart. He, too, had star presence. In front of a crowd, Hart was riveting; in the elevator riding up to the auditorium, he was barely there. Being barely there in the neighborhood Tam-Tam calls home is probably not such a bad thing, and perhaps her drive to be star someday is an elaborate way to wall out the now and here. Ambition is, finally, a form of hope, a scarce commodity in North Dorchester. Back in Rjam's control booth, Dj Reese and producer Ralph Stacey are programming the rhythm track for what will be ""Ho, You're Guilty."" Drum parts are taken from a Roland TR-909 Rhythm Composer, a synth which electronically reproduces programmed beats on the user's choice of drum-matrix. The TR-909's keys, on a console designed to resemble, vaguely, the familiar piano, are named after the sound each creates-bass, snare, mid-tom, hi-tom--and the sounds are named after the actual drums which, until the TR-909, were required to make those sounds. The TR-909 even sports a key named HAND CLAP, making it possible for the first time ever to clap hands with a single finger, rendering obsolete the Zen koan about the sound of one hand clapping. The finished ""Ho, You're Guilty"" will sound lush with percussion, melody, and instrumental breaks. Not one human musician will be employed in the recording process. Each percussion line is programmed onto the mixing board as a separate track: a snare track, a bass track, a clap track, etc. Reese has been studying the classics lately, too, viz: James Brown's Dead on the Heavy Funk from '75ish, including the ageless groove, ""Funky President,"" in which James announces his third-party candidacy. Some of Bobby Byrd's Dead guitar, and a holy moment when James exhales rhythmically, have been isolated from a store-bought cassette of Dead, re-recorded on clean tape, then re-re-recorded onto a computer-readable memory diskette from which the sample is retrieved and altered by Ralph Stacey using a Roland D-50 linear synth. The guitar and the exhalation then go, as altered, from the synth to yet another of the 24 tracks on the big mixing board. Reese, the DJ, will weave a seamless rhythm track out of these 24 strands. As Reese and Ralph Stacey mix the 24 tracks onto one master tape, Tam-Tam sips lemonade in the corner of the booth. You ask her if she is interested someday in learning about the obscure digital technology the two men manipulate on her behalf. She doesn't seem to register the question. ""The other career besides rap I'd like to pursue is modelling,"" she says. ""I'm five-seven. That's the perfect height for a model."" Mixing takes the rest of the day. Producer Ralph Stacey at one late point corners you with a flinty stare and an uncomfortable question: ""Why do you want to write about rap, anyway?"" It is lucky that at that minute Reese is done mixing. Tomorrow the RJam staff will tape Tam-Tam's vocal track and lay this over Reese's rhythm track. Then the sound will be ""fattened"" with stacks of horns, guitar hooks, bells, canned applause, and whatever else they decide to take from other tapes or work up on the Rolands. The final demo tape of ""Ho, You're Guilty"" will then be shopped to the 20 major, minor, and tiny labels who might release the demo as a 12-inch single. Everyone's ready to call it a day. Gary Smith's already huddled with some new wanna-be stars in RJam's reception area. Reese plays the mixed rhythm track once through over the big speakers in the control booth, and Tam-Tam immediately stands, modelling forgotten, utterly alert. Reese gestures to her with maestro hands. She raps at an absent Antoinette in the hard, sexy voice you haven't heard since this morning, extemporaneous but on beat: ""I'm a female You're just a fairytale."" The small-w we here are two white Boston males: one native, one oft-transplanted; both residing in Somerbridge, a dim, ethnic-Portuguese neighborhood whose gentrification we abet. M. is an attorney with a taste for jazz, Blues, funk; D. a grad student and would-be drifter who watches TV instead of sleeping. Our cultural tastes and interests are day and night. They converged only lately, when D's stereo arrived UPS and we discovered we shared an uncomfortable, somewhat furtive, and distinctively white enthusiasm for a certain music called rap/hip-hop.* About our passions and discomforts we could determine only that they were vague & distinct contexts and cathexes brought to bear across the same ethnic distance on the same thing. For instance, we agreed that real or serious rap is not JJ FAD or Tone Loc or Beasties, Egyptian Lover or Fat Boys, not experiments or freakshows or current commercial crossover slush. ""Serious"" rap--a unique U.S. inner-city fusion of funk, technified reggae, teen-to-teen ""hardcore"" rock, and the early 70s ""poetry of the black experience"" of Nikki Giavonni, the Last Poets, etc.--has, since its late-70s delivery at the record-scratching hands of Afrika Bambaataa and his Zulu Nation, Sugarhill Gang, Kool Herc and his automated Herculords, and Grandmaster Flash, always had its real roots in the Neighborhood, the black gang-banger Underground. Black music, of and for blacks. We concurred as to the wheres and whens of rap's begetting--mid-to-late 70s' South Bronx house parties; then, by decade's end, block parties, with municipal electric lights tapped for a power source, literal dancing in the streets; by '82, regular rap-houses and then ""floating clubs""--the Roxy every Sunday, The Bronx's Disco Fever TWTh--everybody Breaking to a new musical antimusic being fashioned from records and turntables and an amateur DJs ad-lib banter; a very heavy reggae influence at the beginning; the more rhythmic pure rap an offshoot, its brisker, sparer, backbeat designed for Breakdance, and the smooth-rapping partygoer who just didn't want to shut up when others' music was on. We agreed, too, on rough chronology: amateur house-partiers giving way to professional DJs, pioneers; they, too, then overshadowed by new art-entrepreneurs, former Breakers, failed singers, gag-majorettes; then the rise of ""Indies,"" the tiny independent labels that keep most new music on life-support--Sugar Hill, Jive, Tommy Boy, Wild Pitch, Profile Records, Enjoy--then, after King Tim III's ""Personality Jock"" and Sugarhill Gang's ""Rapper's Delight,"" an entree into urban black radio; then to underground ""Mix"" radio; then corporate levels, digital technology, very big money, the early-80s talent that became an early Scene's cream--Spoonie G. and Sequence, Eric Fresh, Unknown DJ, Egyptian Lover and Run-DMC. Then, Spring '84, the extraordinary Midas touch of Rick Rubin and Russell Simmons' Def Jam label (now under contract to CBS) from which sprang a mid-80s stable of true stars, in the Underground--Public Enemy, L. L. Cool J, Slick Rick, the still-unparalleled Eric B. and Rakim--and L.A.'s alternatives: Kool Moe Dee, L.A. Dream Team, and others. And now, at decade's end, an absolute explosion of rap-as-pop, big business, MTV, special fashions, posters, merchandise, with only a few big, new, cutting-edge acts--L.A.'s N.W.A., Philadelphia's Schoolly D, Miami's 2 Live Crew, De La Soul's House-blend of rap/funk/jazz--remaining too esoteric or threatening or downright obscene to cross all the way over and cash in with big labels. By '89 rap is finally proving as ""important"" (read also lucrative) to an anemic shock-and rebellion-music industry as Punk was an exact decade ago. This was all just data. We agreed on it, and on how it was curious that we both had such strange, distant facts down cold. Our point of departure, essay-wise, was always less what we know than what we felt, listening: less what we liked than why. For this attempt at an outside sampler we plunked down and listened to thousands of hours of rap, trying to summon a kind of objective, critical, purely ""aesthetic"" passion that the music itself made impossible. For outsiders, rap's easy to move to, hard to dissect. The more we listened and thought and drank beers and argued, the more we felt that the stuff's appeal for two highbrow, upscale whites was just plain incongruous. Because serious rap has, right from the start, presented itself as a closed show. Usually critical questions of culture, context, background and audience reduce quickly to vexed questions about prepositions. Not here. No question that serious rap is, and is very self-consciously, music by urban blacks about same to and for same. To mainstream whites it's a tight cohesion that can't but look, from outside the cultural window, like occlusion, clannishness (sic) and inbreeding, a kind of reverse snobbery about what's ""def"" and ""fresh"" and in-the-Scene that eerily recalls the exclusionary codes of college Societies and WASP-only country clubs. Serious rap is a musical movement that seems to revile whites as a group or Establishment, and simply to ignore their possibility as distinct individuals--the Great White Male is rap's Grand Inquisitor, its idiot questioner--its Alien Other no less than Reds were for McCarthy. The music's paranoia, together with its hermetic racial context, helps explain why from the outside it appears to us just as vibrant and impassioned as it does alien and scary. Other incongruities. Rap is a ""music"" essentially without melody, built instead around a digitally synthesized drum- and back-beat often about as complex as five idle fingers on a waiting-room table, enhanced by ""sampled"" (pirated) ""krush grooves"" (licks or repetitive chord-series) conceived and recorded by pre-rap rock icons, the whole affair characterized by a distinctive, spare, noisy, clattering ""style"" whose obsessive if limited thematics revolve with the speed of low-I amperage around the performative circuit of the MC/rapper and his record-scratching, sound-mixing Sancho Panza, the DJ. The rapper (the guy in the cameo cut or Kangol hat, pricey warm-up, unlaced Adidas, extra thick gold chain or oversized medallion) offers lyrics that are spoken or bellowed in straight, stressed, rhymed verse, the verse's syntax and meter often tortured for rhythmic gain or the kind of limboing-for-rhyme we tend to associate with doggerel about men from Nantucket. The lyrics, nearly always self-referential, tend to be variations on about half a dozen basic themes, themes that at first listen can seem less alien or shocking than downright dull. Eg: just how bad/cool/fresh/def the rapper and his lyrics are; just how equally un-all-these his music rivals are; how troublesome, vacuous and acquisitive women are; how wonderful it is to be ""paid in full"" for rapping instead of stealing or dealing; how gangs are really families, 'caine's constant bad news. And, in particular, how sex and violence and yuppie toys represent perfectly the urban black lifedrive to late-80s American glory. The masks are many, too many for anything really but direct aural inspection: rap personae can change frequently even within single albums, the rapper delivering Hard, violent Black Nationalist communique on one cut, dubbing against Trinidadian steel drums on another, basking in big label eclat on a third, cracking a head and then defly outwitting someone muscled and dumb, cooing to his ""bitch"" and then on the flip side, threatening to go get his gun again if she can't learn who's boss. Though any crew naturally wants its own distinctive game and face, the quintessential rap group is unquintessential, chameleonesque. This is either by weird design, or it's a symptom and symbol of 80s facelessness…or most likely, it's just a good old venerable synecdoche of rap's genre itself, one that's now moving so fast it can't quite fix on its own identity -- much less hold still for anything like cool, critical classification or assessment, from outside. The MC's Alice Toklas-esque DJ hovers ever nearby over his buffet of connected turntables and the black Germanness of a whole lot of digital editing & playback equipment. His responsibility is the song behind and around the rap -- the backbeat, krush groove, and the ""sound carpet,"" i.e. a kind of electric aural environment, a chaos behind the rapper's rhymed order, a digitalized blend of snippets, squeaks, screams, sirens, snatches from pop media, all mixed and splattered so that the listener cannot really listen but only feel the resultant mash of ""samples"" that results. The most recognizable of these samples range from staccato record-scratches to James Brown and Funkadelic licks, to M.L.K.'s public Dream, to quotidian pop pap like ""The Theme from Shaft,"" Brady Bunch dialogue, and '50s detergent commercials. We have now read every review and essay to do with serious underground hip-hop available in every single on-line periodical ... xcept for one or two underground newsletters (viz. The City Sun, Fresh-Est) circulated in parts of the Bronx demimonde where learning about rap is as hard for white outsiders as scoring fine China White or AKs. From the kind of sedulous bibliomaniacal research to be expected of conscientious lawyers and PhDs, the following has become clear. Outside England, where the Punk-weaned audience has developed a taste for spectacle-through-windows, for vicarious Rage and Protest against circumstances that have exactly 0% to do with them, most of what Rolling Stone calls ""devoted rock consumers"" (meaning we post-baby-boomers), plus almost all established rock critics, tend to regard non-crossover rap as essentially boring and simplistic, or swaggering and bellicose and dangerous--at all events, basically vapid and empty because of its obsessive self-referentiality…in short, as closed to them, to us, as a music. Unrecognizable as what we've been trained and adverted to buy as pop.... Great to dance to, of course, but then what might the white audience for today's mainstream expect? Rap, whether fecund or sterile, is today's pop music's lone cutting edge, the new, the unfamiliar, the brain-resisted-while-body-boogies. And that resisted, alien, exhilarating cutting edge has always been black. ""What have you left me? what have I got? Last night in cold blood my young brother got shot My homey got jacked My mother's on crack My sister can't work cause her arms show tracks Madness, insanity Live in profanity Then some punk claim that they understandin' me? Give me a break--what world do you live in? Death is my sex--guess my religion.""** What makes this stuff so much more disturbing, more real to outsiders than the Punk Rock even those of us who remember it could never quite take seriously? Maybe even a closed music has to have some kind of detente with received custom: I always found it tough to listen straight-faced to a nihilist lecture from someone with a chartreuse mohawk and an earring in his eyelid who punctuates his delivery with vomit and spit. All doctrine and pronouncement, exclusively anti-, this Punk of a decade past afforded even willing mainstream listeners no easement across cultural void, nothing human to grab onto. I have no idea what a Punk performer thinks, feels, is, day-to-day... in fact I always suspected he had no day, but just retreated to his plush coffin at cockcrow. Can you imagine a Punk with four-foot hair and spiked jacket and nose-ring, say, eating a bologna sandwich? Replacing a light bulb? Putting a quarter in a meter? Not me, boy. And even Barnum, who knew fear sells, also knew that freakshows aren't frightening when the freakishness supplants all resemblance. 0% affinity = 0% empathy. And fear requires empathy as much as it does menace or threat. Public Enemy and N.W.A., Ice T and Schoolly D discomfit us, our friends, the critics we read and cornered, because the Hard rappers' lyrics are conscientious about being of/for the real lives and attitudes of recognizable, if alien, persons. Here's where it's a level up from mere spectacle: ideology in Hard rap is always informed by incident or named condition. This makes rap not only better than Punk, but way scarier. Serious Hard raps afford white listeners genuine, horse's-mouth access to the life-and-death plight and mood of an American community on the genuine edge of im-/explosion, an ugly new sub-nation we've been heretofore conditioned to avoid, remand to the margins, not even see except through certain carefully abstract, attenuating filters. For outsiders, rap is hard to dissect, easy to move to. The command is: dance, don't understand; participate, don't manipulate. Rap is a fortress protected by the twin moats of talk and technology. The first is that nu style of speak--the ""dialect drug,"" De La Soul calls it--that rappers fashion from jive and disseminate through record stores to all of us. Some in-words, like ""fly,"" meaning ""finelooking,"" have been in coin since the beginning, now venerable as Old English because they turn up on Grandmaster Flash cuts from '82. Others, like ""dead presidents,"" rap for $$, are either coming into or going out of currency, depending on when you read this. Rap, a club language, has myriad ways to describe one's own or others' looks. ""Fly"" is how a man digs a woman. One would never describe oneself as ""fly,"" even when cataloguing one's own attractions (done more in rap than anyplace except perhaps Village Voice personals). ""Fresh"" means irresistibly stylish, oft-modified by ""funky,"" ""crazy,"" or ""stoopid,"" predominantly used to convey the fly-ness of things other than women, including oneself or one's rap, which two concepts rappers, like schizophrenics, can't always keep separate in their heads. ""Dope"" means ""def,"" and ""def"" means crazy funky stoopid fresh. Synonyms include: the shit, the It, the cool, the thang, the word, the grooviest, the categorical imperative, die weltanschung, the that-which-Potter-Stewart-would-know-if-he-saw. A def rapper is so style-defining as to make the stylish mere copycats. To be def is to rap to the beat of a different drum machine--not seeking solitude, but rather confident that others will follow. The def rapper MC's a def rap, which rap def-ly tells of its own (and the rapper's) def-ness--so def, as MC/manager, entrepreneur Russell Rush Simmons brags, that it had to be on a label called Def Jam. Rap celebrates power, equating strength with style, and style with the ""I"" in ""Individuality."" Rappers ""dis""--dismiss--the styleless, faceless. To ""ill"" is to be weak or wrong; to ""bite"" is to thieve another's dope beat. And only the ill would bite. Early remastered pop was the first fake music ever, since what the record buyer of '63 experienced as Aural Event on his turntable couldn't happen live. Rock began to become an Illusion of Event which technology made possible; rock became more like the movies, starting down a long road at the end of which was MTV. Not that this kept Phil Spector up nights. The gurus of the studio had fatter fish to clean, for the new freedom to shape sound had come at a price. With each magnetic jump from live, as tape was made of tapes which were themselves tapes of tapes, the hiss and crackle of interference multiplied. Dual high-bias media with 2 units each of sonic garbage per 10,000 units of Elvis Presley, retaped on similar 2-units-per-10,000 tape, became 4 units of hiss; retaped, 8; then 16; then 32. As the sound got fuller, it decayed. The solution was a breakthrough called multi-tracking--using recorders that could capture and play back on 2 (as in stereo), 4 (as in '67's then-ear-shattering Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Heart's Club Band), 12, 16, and today 24 parallel tracks, eliminating the hiss of transference from one machine to the next. Rhythms, melodies, harmonies could all be captured on separate tracks, allowing the performer or producer to mix and listen and re-mix, adding vocals or lead instrument on yet another track. Rap Edisons like Kool Herc, Grandmaster Flash and Afrika Bambaataa began as party DJs, not musicians. Their wiring of twin turntables to a mixer, allowing them to ""stack"" the sound of two different records while rapping into a mike, was a kind of crude, extemporaneous multitracking. Technological loops like those in the NASA-esque studios of CBS and Polygram were now in the hands of the homeboys. Carter was President. The Bee Gees, with five Top-Ten hits in twelve months, were king. Digital recording, the science dividing Rjam's Tam-Tam on tape from Tam-Tam as heard ""live"" is a technology that converts music to codes or ""digits."" The codes are ""read"" by a computer, one combining sophisticated sound-to-code translation hardware with a number-crunching COS and a high-response synthesizer, at speeds of 40,000 digits per second and up. The recorded sounds, reduced to numbers, can be shaped, mangled, muffled, amplified, and even canonized.*** Hardware then translates the digits, as read and altered, back into sound, which can itself be recorded on multitrack and combined with yet more sounds. The result: hiss-free reproduction on an infinity of tracks, each of which can itself be manipulated infinitely. Digital recording, part of the 80s sea-change in how pop gets made, divides the responsibility for the final song more or less equally between the performer, the engineer at the mixing board, the producer who coordinates the multi-tracking and mixing process, and the electronic hardware that actually ""makes"" the music we buy. The latest synthesizers**** produce notes from pure electric current instead of electronically amplified vibrations, with voltage-meters rather than hands or feet determining everything from key to pitch to timbre to ""attack-delay envelope"" (another non-rap term, denoting the microtimed, counterpoised quality of a note's duration, how a note's sound/quaver-structure as it builds is different from its sound and structure as it fades--the manipulation of a piano's foot-pedals, for example, affects the delay component of each note and chord's envelope). The Kurzweil 250, a state-of-the-art system, is a 1-?track/12,018-note synthesizer linked by software to an Apple MacIntosh Plus, which serves as an exhaustive library of digitized sound. The Kurzweil could put all of culture in a blender--take Janet Leigh's Cremora-curdling scream from Psycho, store it in the Mac, program the synth such that an F# will be reproduced as Janet Leigh's F# scream, then play ""We Shall Overcome"" as if screamed by Janet Leigh; store this; treat similarly Bach's St. Matthew's Passion, except with vast choruses of screaming Janet Leighs, then ""Mary Had a Little Lamb,"" then ""Twist and Shout"" (by the Isleys, not the Beatles), all as screams; then replay the four as one horrific jumble, or select amidst the jumble; and then whatever you came up with in the final, painstakingly re-mixed mix you could play backwards. And call that ""finished."" Or never finish. It's like holding music at gunpoint. You can make it do--or do to you --whatever you can think of. Whim is the only limit. Basically we decided we were into rap because, even media-hype aside, this music had some kind of hard edge to it. Date of composition here is July '89. Think back. This last has been a fiscal year in which Madonna's ""back on top,"" in which covers of classic covers of classic tunes are themselves covered and then climb corporate charts, in which Rod Stewart's out of cryogenics and back on top.... MTV's ceased to be anything but a long commercial for itself and the interests of corporate labels; Bobby McFerrin makes a platinum mint and then several commercial jingles out of a burbled synth-reggae invitation to ""Be Happy,"" a song that has the same verbal-pre-packaging feel as ""Where's the Beef?"" This last year heavy metal's fake-Satanist male models accounted for 1/2 of total U.S. record sales; U2 filmed a $20,000,000 homage to their own self-righteousness and Bono's ever more ill-disguised megalomania. A year when even good old REM finally went corporate-pop with Green, when good old Springsteen trashed his bride, when as modest and nascent a talent as Tracy Chapman earned cymbal-crashing critical raves for her competent, updated frappe of Baez and Armatrading, so desperate were pop critics and consumers for any voice at once comprehensible and even remotely fresh. Just not a notable pop year at all. Except in rap. Rap appears in the famished late 80s as potentially a genuine musical Scene the way early jazz, rock, the Summer of Love, folk/protest, god even the way New Wave and Punk were ""Scenes""--the S-word here simultaneously meaning: something new to look at; something loud and upsetting (""Oh please, Veronica, let's not have a Scene!""); and, best, an identifiable set of places in time where large forces meet, marry and beget. Whether by virtue or default, rap is pretty much what there is to like right now, if you want to regard today's pop as anything more than covert jingles in 4/4-time. In our opinion. But so the point is we enjoy it. Plus we've developed some theses about why serious rap is important, both as art-for-own-sake and as a kind of metaphor-with-larynx for a subbed-culture unique in its distillation of the energy and horror of the American present. Rap is expanding gas-like through the 80s' dry time, growing from house party schtick, gang anthem, a small-label fad with the sort of pop lifespan you measure with eggtimers--then somehow, when we weren't looking, into Scene, movement, On The Air--finally, in the last 24 months, assuming the fecund role of genuine Genre. Exploding into subspecies now faster than you can track. There's now Dub's mix of rap and reggae, House's mix of rap and 70s-, huge-afro'd funk, Acid House's psychedelic hip-hop. There is black rap for white mass-consumption (Tone Loc, Run?DMC), black rap for local set and -house consumption (countless local stars and wanna-be's in every large city), ultra-black rap superstars for the whole marginal Nation inside (Heavy D, Public Enemy, Big Daddy Kane), white rap for white masses (the execrable Beastie Boys). There is Hispanic, Salsa-influenced rap out of different West Coast barrios, rap fused with West Indian or Islamic traditional music in Digital Underground, Eric B. and Rakim, and others, or fused with oh-so-danceable R&B in the new ""jack swing"" offshoot (Bobby Brown, MC Hammer); even gay and bohemian young urban Bs have their trendsetters in Teddy Riley and Guy, De La Soul, Kwabe. Etc. etc.***** A major impediment to sampling this Scene is the kaleidoscopic fury with which the Scene itself is changing. If you're reading this in print it's already dated. And the rap world's vitality is one of replacement as well as variety, allowing the genre to remain fresh, as band after band is seduced into the ""real"" music biz. This Scene is hydra-like. Almost the moment a rap artist like Run-DMC or L. L. Cool J ""breaks through"" into major-market mix appeal, MTV's land of corporate bankability, certain reactions within the urban underground that spawned them can almost always be observed. The breakthrough band's B-boys themselves are without qualms about the pop bigtime: after all, they've been rapping all along about their entitlement to money and status, about the inevitable rewards of their freshness and unbiteable voice. Their postbreakthrough raps tend all often to become celebrations of their new wealth and fame, of the now-enhanced authority of their ""Message""--though it's hard to feature Public Enemy rapping about a Black-Militant renaissance, about revolution and American apocalypse, while lily-white CBS Records pays them millions for the distribution rights to just such exhortations to cut corporate throats. Nevertheless, back in the underground Scene, the breakthrough band's tight set of original fans tends to hang loyal, to await feverishly ""their"" crew's spots on the same music TV they love to dis. In short, there are comparatively few of the accusations of selling out that accompanied a similarly oxymoronic coopting phenomenon in late-60s protest rock. Which if you think about it, is passing strange. The white mainstream Other against which serious rap aligns and defines itself makes the 60s ""Establishment"" too look downright benign. Our opinion, then, from a distance: not only is a serious rap serious poetry, but, in terms of the size of its audience, its potency in the Great 80s Market, its power to spur and to authorize the artistic endeavor of a discouraged and malschooled young urban culture we've been encouraged sadly to write off,6 it's quite possibly the most important stuff happening in American poetry today. ""Real"" (viz. academic) U.S. poetry, a world no less insular than rap, no less strange or stringent about vocab, manner, and the contexts it works off, has today become so inbred and (against its professed wishes) inaccessible that it just doesn't get to share its creative products with more than a couple thousand fanatical, sandal-shod readers, doesn't get to move or inform more than a fraction of that readership (most of the moved being poets themselves), doesn't generate revenue for much of anyone save the universities to whom the best PhD-poets rent their names and time ... and especially does not inspire a whole culture's youth to try to follow in their Connecticut-catalogue brogans' prints. Because of rap's meteoric rise, though, you've got poor kids, tough kids, ""underachievers,"" a ""lost generation""... more young people--ostensibly forever turned off ""language"" by TV, video games and low U.S.D.E. budgets--more of these kids hunched over notebooks on their own time, trying to put words together in striking and creative ways, than the U.S.A. has probably ever had at one time. That few of these will become ""stars"" matters far less than the grim stats about, say, the tiny percentage of playground basketball phenoms who actually ride sports out and up from subclass status: the same verbal skills and enthusiasms rap values (and values enough to let rap-dissing stand symbolically for fighting or killing) can obviously be applied in mainstream-approved, ""productive"" ways--G.E.D.'s college, Standard Written English ...perhaps someday even ad-copywriting! But is this wildfire of urban rap ambition raging around converted four-car garages like North Dorchester's RJam's in spite of the genre's near-disciplinary prosodic restrictions, or because of them? Can't really tell. Probably doesn't matter. The fact remains that, were ""important poetry"" presently defined in terms of what makes important art important in a Supply-Side democracy (popularity, effect, the separation of fan from his cash), staid journals like Poetry and American Poetry Review would be featuring some number of fade-cut, multiple-earring'd authors' photos in each issue; and highbrow public readings would always carry their back row fraction of bangers ready to ""listen rude"" to Wilbur and Levertov and Ashbery, just as e.g Rimbaud and Pound did to their own contemporaries ... to the delight and invigoration of a time's poetry... ... And even just the prospected fantasy of seeing Public Enemy's be-clocked Flavor Fav and like a Jorie Graham or Amy Clampitt sitting down over beer and Celestial Seasonings to hash out the debate over line-breaks in dactylic pentameter, a very serious young homeboy in Italian silk and pentagonal shades serving as interpreter is enough to make us hereby officially lobby for the admission of rhyme's renaissance--at least under the stringent rhythmic demands rap has forced on rhyme-as-form--to the cold corridors of Serious Appreciation. Unlike the mostly docile poetry and fiction of the late 80s, though, rap's own quality, the def freshness of the MC's bit, is set up to be judged primarily in the context of what it is against. In case you thought we forgot, rap is first of all a movement in rock music, and thus the time-honored requirement is that the rap Scene set itself very consciously athwart those circumstances and forces whose enormity is required by all rock 'n roll to justify one of its essential roles, rebellion-against. Except now watch the objects of the rebellion alter, spread, grow in urgency--from the 50s' parents and principals, homework, hot rods, the sweet hurt of teen love, to the urban 80s, police, violent death, homelessness, the lure of ecstatic drugs that dehumanize weaponry, fatherlessness, the animal emptiness of sex w/o love, the almost Trilaterally sinister White Establishment (""THE GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSIBLE THE GOVERNMENT'S. . . ""), Everyone Else: life as a series of interruptions from an angry slumber about what the electric voices say you must have and the human voices say you may not, about the betrayal of the past, of the promises exacted by Carmichael, X, and the now-formal martyrdom of King. Segregation may affect their hearts and minds, Earl Warren warned, as Malcolm X and Louis Farrakhan, both alumni of Boston's old separate-but-awful schools, bear loud witness. Now, 40 years after X disgustedly quit a racist high school and began a career as a kind of be-bop gang-banger, 35 years after Brown v. Board of Education invented integration, 15 years after Morgan v. Hennigan brought Brown to Boston, North Dorchester is worse and its schools aren't better. A former United States Secretary of Education converts to Drug Czar, symbolizing a national change of mind: now drugs, not poor schools (and certainly not the American apartheid of which segregated schools were but one facet), is our root ""innercity"" problem. Tam-Tam's Boston is strangely less hopeful than the notoriously segregated pre-Hennigan city, perhaps because before Hennigan reformers could promise that segregation was why things were so bad. Segregation was blame's bullseye: abolish the bullseye, and blame for the estrangement of the races flies everywhere, hitting the cops, or the courts, or the teachers, or the taught, or what's taught. There's even a rap--B.D.P.'s ""Why is That?""--blaming our miseries on the failure of the schools to ""teach black kids to be black."" But everything the white rock listener pays to enjoy is black-begotten. If today's Top?40 environment seems bleak or befouled, imagine the present mainstream without its sweetest sourcewaters, without the King-Waters-King Blues trinity, the Brownian soul, the backbeat, cut time, blue notes, funky French curves of sax and brass, the guitar solo, call-and-response, the Cold Medina or Lucky Powder, those lithely syncopated quintets in pomade and linen suits, the single hand in the white glove holding Pepsi aloft in the shadow of accidental flames.... Black music is American pop's breath and bread; and we, as both born audience and born salesmen, know it. So maybe it's them. Them. Maybe we're approaching an enforced fork in the musical road where the white-run entertainment industry will have to pack up what it's taken and go seek its fortune on the backs of new minorities. Maybe, in serious rap, the extreme new insulation of the black sound is not only intentional but preplanned, part of a neo-Nationalist agenda, the hermetic new Scene's tight circle more like something large and coiled than something small and flat. You may now be getting some hazy idea of the sorts of really quite scary possibilities with which the rap we like is replete. And, hazier, of how complicated this stuff of sampler-from-outside can be. What's remained passing strange, for use, is the vague threat's appeal. The unease and ambivalence with which the rare white at the window loves rap renders that love no less love. Whence the fear, though, is really no matter. For look at the world, at the masses we're part of. At what you look at closest. The plain 80s data is that, whereas love, devotion, passion seem only to divide, it's fear and strangeness that bind crowds, fill halls, unite Us, somehow, as audience, under the great tent. *'Hip-hop' is an older synonym, coined by Rap pioneer, Kool Herc, to describe the heavily danceable Jamaican scatting he introduced between records at the huge South Bronx block parties he and other new-Scene celebrities, like Jazzy Five and former Black Spades leader, Afrika Bambaataa, could turn into late-70s frenzies of Breakdance (both music and dance a self-conscious reaction against the glittered unreality of downtown Disco). **Except but now hey kids! thanks to AT&T you can now speak directly to Ice T and hear his philosophy of life by phone! 1-900-907-9111. ""Chill out with Ice T,"" the rapper adrape in military hardware and ammunition says on MTV, ""I'm just waiting on you to call me,"" pointing at the camera and then himself lest the audience get at all confused. ""Don't forget to ask your parent's permission first"" (white corporate voice-over)--$2.00 first minute, etc. etc. ***""Canon"" being another non-jive rap term, meaning the division of a single sequence of sound into two or more repeating sound-sequences, like a vocal round. **** ... themselves the heirs of a long, 20th-century evolutionary process, from the playe-?piano to the 20s Oncles Martenot and Theremin and Trautonium (crude electronic instruments big in France), to Pierre Schaeffer's musique concrete in '48, to the first Electronic Music Synthesizer invented by engineers at RCA in the 50s to the inauguration of the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center in '59, to Robert Moog's '64 development of the Moog 55, the first emitter of amplified ""blurps, fwipps, simps, twings, and schlonks"" to be commercially produceable. Walter/Wendy Carlos used a Moog 55 for his/her '68 Switched-On Bach, an album that did more than anything to popularize synthesized sound. ***** Note how the ecstatic force's movement extends beyond sound into dance-Chicago-based house-dancing is very different from Coast-based rap-dancing, while both are distinct from the Quaalude sway a De La Soul's lazy complexity invites--and beyond dance into urban haute couture itself. The ""cameo"" or ""fade,"" that troubling cyberpunk flat-top haircut favored by Carl Lewis and Grace Jones but popularized by the group Cameo's rapping Larry Blackmon, has now become less a haircut than a sculptural statement: words, logos, slogans and complex signs razored into the rigid anvil of hair that is, according to the Voice, ""the most culturally conscious unisex hairstyle since the afro."" The standard 80s-rap uniform--sideways baseball cap or Kangol, ropey chains, acetate warmup and unlaced hightops--""...now symbolizes a cruder, more casual era,"" and is diffracting into a rap-House-gay-jackswing look replete with polka-dot ties, loose pleated twills, and expensive dance-loafers or British ""moon boots,"" a combination Ricky Ricardo-Frank Sinatra dapper that now befits a Scene with the dignity, silliness and pull of real Genre. Plus don't forget that just one big change in street and school fashions means millions and millions in garment revenue--even more $$ once the white mainstream, as is its won't, follows in the cutting edge's media-delayed wake. ****** ""We've lost a whole generation to their own culture out here,"" rues an LAPD Assistant Commissioner in a 14 May '89 Boston TV news special on the national Wa-?On gangs, drugs, crime, Others…"

32,Dr. Dre,Kush - Main," 5. SZA ft. Chance The Rapper – ""Childs Play"" Produced by Dae One & XXYYXX The one sample on the record is taken from an XXYYXX produced track, ""About You."" Dae One took the track and used it for the backbone of this new composition. He then added an array of hi hats, 808s & snares to bring the new beat together. – DC26  4. 50 Cent – ""In Da Club"" Produced by Dr Dre & MIke Elizondo The production features blaring horns, funky organs, guitar riffs and sparse hand claps. The repeating string chords, knocking drums and plucked guitar phrases make for a track that contains just enough variations to keep your ears glued to the speaker while avoiding any confusion. For the second verse they added additional a string and brass based orchestra. Also, apparently D12 passed on the beat This was the first of seven tracks which he recorded with Dr. Dre in five days. 50 explained how the recording process went:Dre, he'll play dope beats ... , 'These are the hits, 50. So pick one of these and make a couple of singles or something.' The very first time he heard  'In Da Club' he said, 'Yo, I didn't think you was going to go there with it, but, you know, it works.' He was probably thinking of going in a different direction with that song. Then he expanded it into a hit record. –0nelove 3. Phantogram – ""Fall In Love"" This blaring, heavily synthesized sensation contains samples from a highly unlikely source - Barbara Mason's ""Yes, I'm Ready."" The main sampled portion can be heard 27 seconds in, and the ""Fall"" vocal that is sampled throughout the song can be heard 44 seconds in. – streetlights  2. Dr Dre ft Akon & Snoop Dogg – ""Kush"" Produced by Danny Keyz & DJ Khalil  1. Nas – ""I'm a Villain"" from Illmatic XX. Produced by Jae Supreme In the words of producer Jae Supreme: i met nas through my cousin syl drama. nas was his homeboy. they were younger than me, so i didn’t run with their crew. being my blood cousin, syl drama was always at my studio (prime cuts ny) recording songs. he would let nas and his other people here the joints, and that’s what prompted nas to ask syl if he could come to the studio with him. syl told me he was ill, so i said bring him through. nas loved alota of the james brown samples i would use, so i took one of the loops from a song i did for myself called “swinga”, and made a different beat with it for him. he went in the booth and spit that rhyme in one take. i was impressed. i gave him a copy of it, and that was it. i really didn’t think about that song too much until i heard him on live at the bbq. i was like oh ****, that’s that kid nas my cousin brought to the studio. he was working with large pro by that time, and i guess that’s where the confusion came in with everyone thinking large pro did the “villain” track. i honestly didn’t think the song would get that much love, until i saw it circulating around the internet. i’m glad i got to do a few joints with nas before he really blew up Here’s a song my cousin SYL DRAMA did with Nas & Cormega = 40TH SIDE OF THINGS"

42,Eagles,Hotel California - 2013 Remaster,"ESSAYS THAT STILL NEED SOME LOVE!!!WHAT DO I DO ONCE I'VE RECEIVED FEEDBACK?1st PeriodPrompt: Discuss the greatest challenge you have faced or expect to face. I expect college to be a challenge. It may not be the most difficult challenge but it would be formidable. However, like any challenge I have faced it will be crushed. I’ll have to learn new concepts that are at least new to me. I might be perplexed by the way the system functions. However, I have a general idea of how college will operate. I just don’t have all the details. Will I like the professor? Will I not? I don’t know much about it. I will have to find out. I know the expectations will be different than any typical high school. Also, some high schools are more challenging than college. I’ll have to adapt to the new environment and change my study habits. College could also be easy. I don’t know. I still have many questions and I’ll assume that they will be answered. I guess it will be a new adventure. I still don’t really know. It’s just another step up. Even if I’m entering strange territory, I’m still confident; I’ll see what they throw at me. I know that we can request are classes to be spread out and if this is the case it will be easier because of the extra time per class. Whether it’s challenging or easy I’ll finish it. Prompt: Indicate a person who has had a significant influence on you, and describe that influence. “My mama always used to tell me: ‘If you can’t find somethin’ to live for, you best find somethin' to die for,” – Tupac Shakur. My greatest influence is Tupac Shakur. His words have always resonated with me. I’ve looked up to him since I was a young boy. I credit my father for introducing me to my greatest role model outside of my family. “A coward dies a thousand times, a soldier dies but once.” The best influence I gained from Mr. Shakur was to have a strong heart, will, and mind. With these things intact no way you can be deterred by anyone else. Letting someone break your down your heart to fight to can break your will. If you lose your will you can become weak minded and you need all three to survive. It’s like he always said, “If you can make it through the night, there’s a brighter day.” “I think I’m a natural-born leader. I know how to bow down to authority if it’s authority that I respect.” Another lesson I learned was to never give in to anyone and say what’s on your mind. The first amendment is the right to freedom of speech. Shakur believed that we all should exercise this right. He also believed that no badge of authority is just given respect but, it is earned just as anyone else will have to earn it. “Sh*t, I like to think that at every opportunity I’ve ever been threatened with resistance, it’s been met with resistance. And not only me but it goes down my family tree. You know what I’m saying, it’s in my veins to fight back.” It was in his blood to fight back that’s why he’ll never bow down to just any authority. “I see myself as a natural born hustler, a true hustler in every sense of the word. I took nothin’, I took the opportunities, I worked at the most menial and degrading job and built myself up so I could get it to where I owned it. I went from having somebody manage me to me hiring the person that works my management company. I changed everything I realized my destiny in a matter of five years you know what I’m saying I made myself a millionaire. I made millions for a lot of people now it’s time to make millions for myself; you know what I’m saying. I made millions for the record companies; I made millions for these movie companies, now I make millions for us” here he says he worked and earned every penny he has and gained his respect along with it. Hard work gives you everything you deserve. Prompt: What makes you, you? My life had many ups and downs, when I was a baby I was filled with smiles, laughed all the time, but that soon changed. I became an angry child or waterfalls of tears would run off may face during my child hood. Over time I learned to accept life, and then I learned to be happy. And I became a rosy cheek kid that tries to live an easy going life. when I was a kid with a face as red as a burring flame on the sun and sad, it all seem to be tied to how my life was going, my father was arrested and I could only see him for short times compared to when I spent entire days with him. I started living with people I barely knew but my mom new quite well, these people where called grandparents. And the things I always knew where changing for the rest of my life and it was a lot for a kid of four to take in and, caused pain for many years. Later in my life the streams if tears flowed so rapidly that soon I tried to make dams of rope at the line of the neck. My grandfather that I did not know as I child I learned to love like a second father had passed. So with the dames at a brake I knew it was time for a change. Whenever I would feel down I would search the ends of the earth to find the good in what is happening so that helped me learn how to except the negative thing that happen in my life. Once my grandfather passed who we depended on with most of our lives, poverty had soon come. We struggled to feed our self’s and we ended up having to move to a house a third of the size of what we once had. With that I learned to enjoy a loaf of bread instead of wanting a five course meal. With all the challenges that happened in my life I grew to a bigger, stronger, and better person. Through my whole life the warmth of a mother hug and the kiss from the heart a grandmother gives when times seem blue helped me adapt the love and care I try to share with others. In the past I was a heated person temper as strong as an ox. But there is only so much anger a person can handle in their life and over time I became to be where only the biggest things can makes my blood boil. After having a past of anger and people who said I was weird and a nut, I decided to let it roll off the cheek and became determined to still be that nut but be the best I can, I adapted determination from that point on. Through the roller coaster of my life I’ve lived hard painful times, with loss of love ones and massive changes. And I’ve had good times as well with love and happiness. People would think on how I was as a child I would be this miserable adult but they were wrong. I am living proof that challenges as hard as they may come can make a better person. I was a dark souled being that changed into a great, loving and, caring person. Who is determined and fallows my dreams. Prompt: Describe an important transition in your life. Since we were born we were told how important college is, we were told that we should already know what we want to do, and what college we want to attend. Even though we really don’t have any fore knowledge on what college really is, we are still expected to go. This, to me is the hardest transition anyone can face, making it the most important. Figuring out what you want to be when you grow up, we have been asked this question ever since the beginning of public school, kindergarten. Isn’t it ridiculous? Asking a five year what he/she wants to do when she/he is 20. Back then we all were oblivious to how fast life really moves; we didn’t know that outside of crayons and story time, there was a world waiting to be explored. Even though we had no idea where money comes from, or how a government works, we were still asked, “what do you want to be when you grow up?” Present day, that question triggers anxiety, and pent up confusion, because the answer isn’t as simple as “rock star” anymore, now you need a real answer. People say that high school is the best years of school you will ever have, because we can’t go back to it. Make your friends now, keep up with your grades, join school clubs, and get a part time job, pay your dues, graduate. It’s either now or never, go big or get a GED. Being pressured into going to college is probably the worst thing that can happen to anyone, it isn’t the 1960’s anymore, and we have other options. With tuition rising and employment decreasing, graduating college and getting a job is harder than ever, not to mention student loans. That’s why I feel this transition is so important, it opens the eyes of our generation, and things aren’t easy. We’ve all been handed a crystal clear picture of going to college being the only thing we can do. Growing up happens fast, and this still goes for the lucky ones that already have an idea of what they want to do after high school. For us, graduation will be the strangest feeling, no more school, no more summer break, no more standardized tests, we will all be floating around in our cap and gown trying to grasp the fact that we are done. I think that’s when you actually become an adult, because; isn’t that what adulthood is? Just a bunch of kids trying to figure everything out. That’s what makes this transition an important one, because it’s the hardest one we will face. Prompt: Discuss some issue of personal, local, or national concern and its importance to you Police Brutality is a national concern we need to put an end to. The people who are supposed to be protecting us are killing us! We the people must eliminate this racism and brutality in our police force. There is no time to waste action must be takin now. Brutality is not the way anyone should go. Our right as a citizen must be protected at all times. Nobody is above our rights or laws. Black minorities are the main people targeted by this threat. Most people would’ve thought we’ve move passed this racism. Equality is what needs to be seen in the eyes of not just officers but everyone. In my own experience I’ve seen white cops treat other races (Mainly Blacks) as if they were animals. We are no different than anyone else. Cops need to accept the fact that we are all the same on the inside. People are getting shot and killed for no reason. In the United States, major political and social movements have involved excessive force by police. Prompt:  “Describe a Person who has Influenced Your Life- Grandpa” As the sun began to peak through the fine curtains, I clenched my eyes and inhale the sweet odor of homemade biscuits and smoky sausages specially made by my pleasurable grand-mama. My limps felt detached and strained but my stomach was roaring another tune, soon became in debate with worn-out body. I eased to the edge of the bed leisurely took a quick glance at the clock. I didn’t bother reading the time though; I just know it was too early to hear that faint bussing outside. It was Saturday morning and the routine remained the same as always, I shimmied over to the one window facing the back yard already knowing what I was searching for, my grand-daddy. My grand-daddy wore a plaid red and black shirt, faded blue jean overalls and some dusty old work boot to mow the lawn in the early morning as, he rode his lawn mower from side to side and every few seconds he would briefly slowed down to spit his burnt sienna colored chewing tobacco, wipe his mouth with a bright white handkerchief and continue his journey. My grand-daddy is the chief of the Totten family. Born and raised in Yanceyville, North Carolina. He received only a 5th grade education and from there worked in the family business of farmers. He is the second youngest of four brothers and a sister. Out of all of his siblings except his sister he was the only one to ever go to school and come out with a work ethic of devotion. He puts his all in everything he does from head to toe this man has gave honor to the Totten’s name. Prompt:  Indicate a person who has had a significant influence on me, and describe that influence. The one person who has changed my life the most has to be both of my brother’s for good and bad. My brothers have had the most influence on me because I don’t want to be anything like at all. They both have been in and out of jail not for anything big like rape or murder but for dumb things like weed. But it’s not the fact that they went to jail that scary me and makes me not want to be anything like them but it the fact I seen everything that my mother has gone through because of brother’s and that’s what makes me want to be nothing like them fools. So yea that’s why I don’t want to be anything like my bothers they are good for nothing that just mess things up in my life and everyone else life there even messing up your life right now you don’t even know it. But for real if anyone how had impacted my life it would be them for the fact that I don’t want to be like them. But then you could look at it for another point of view and say they actually are good because of their massive mistake now I wound not make the same mistake they did. Topic: The Place That I Know Well Texas is the place that I know well. I have been to Texas lots of times in my life. Texas is a great place to be at. There are lots of things that you can do in Texas. It is a place that you ca have a great time and also relaxes. It is the place that I know bather than anything else in the world. Texas is where most of the things happen. You can feel the heat thrower your skin as you get closer to Texas. You can see lots of different things happening at the same time. Lots of cars passing by you as you go thrower the highway. There are lots of restaurant where you can eat at. You can small the different foods once you go inside the restaurant. Texas is as big as the United States. Every time I go to Texas I just can just relaxes all day. I feel happy every time I go there. It is the place that can make you feel safe at all times. It is where I can see lots of things that can make you feel happy. For example every time I go to the beach I have a great time there. Also when I go to see family members and have a great time with them. Prompt: If you offered the role of the villain or the hero in a movie, which role would you accept and why? Here come Jaeblast!! As the crowd would scream as I enter a nearby metropolis to save the day from evil. The role of a super hero is one role I would consider a choice of picking. Having superpower would be insane for me to decline that role because I would see myself as a protagonist and I believe I’m a good person by heart and soul. I believe in superhero’s since the day I could open my eyes. As the year passed my inspiration for the famous superhero Flash has grown over time. Flash has been Favorable to me due to the fact that he was a scientist in his own field in which I’m going to college to study/Major in. Whenever I see or watch Flash I think of myself in a scientific/energetic way of thinking. The flash was a scientist before he was even notice as a hero of the comic books. Prompt: “Advice you can give to students just starting their high school career” There are many advantages of going to high school and staying there for the full time that you should be there. At the same time there are many pitfalls and students can become confuse by the many decisions that we are forced to make. In most cases high school students want to make the best decisions about their future, and so it is important to learn of the various resources available to help make the right decisions as they will make an impact on life after high school. There are many advantages of going to high school. High school will provide you with many opportunities that will help to develop life-long skills such as learning, social and mental development. High school helped me to lay down foundations for growth and development so that I can become a productive and good member of the community. The knowledge presented in high school can help build the necessary foundations for a career you may be interested in. Students can learn various subjects such as business, health, sciences, trades, skills and technology, all of which can be apply to knowledge needed for careers in these fields or other fields. Experiences in high school can also provide you with opportunities for career development. In high school students can meet partners in business, science, technology and other fields and they can learn about these careers and professions from experts in the field. In some high schools, experts come in on career day and talk to the students about the various careers and professions. I always love when they come in. These events can also help students to decide what careers they want to get into when the leave high school. Another benefit is that going to high school helps students to build relationships with people such as teachers and other professionals in the fields already. When these professionals come in on career day, students can build professional relationships. You can get the experts as mentors and preceptors in the field. In high school you will also build relationships with each other and agree to go to college together. For me, I have very few friends that I can continue to be friendly with and hopefully go to college with. Some students would go to the same college and enter into the same or similar fields and in doing so long lasting friendly and work career relationships can be created. Another advantage in attending high school is that you get to learn about new methods and new technology in the workplace so that they can be more prepared when they leave school. There are many resources in high schools that with help benefit students. High school will prepare students to make better decisions about careers and about colleges where they can advance and go into careers, or further studies that they may want to do. Sometimes, I am not sure what job or profession I want to do after I leave school. The guidance counselors in high school will hopefully help to guide and direct my career paths. Resources such as libraries, career centers, and academies like science academy or technology academy can help me to learn about these specific fields. Schools have resources such as the internet that I can use to learn more about colleges and careers. There are also many resources such as books, brochures and pamphlets that will tell me about careers and colleges. While there are many advantages of going to high school and many resources to guide you, there are just as many pitfalls that can be misleading and dangerous. The large amounts of decisions that confront students can be overwhelming. Students may find pressure to make decisions and may rush into making decisions that they are not comfortable making. You might also rush and make decisions to please your parents. Sometimes I feel like I am being rushed by my mother to make a decision, but I have to remind her that I need to make my mind up. Another pitfall is that students could just be following their friends. Peer pressure could push students to make the wrong decisions for college, or peer pressure may force students to drop out of school. In high school you cannot cave into peer pressure. I had to make a personal decision for myself. High school students must be strong and make decisions best for themselves and their families. Another pitfall in high school is that students may become overwhelm by the many resources offered in school and that may result in the student not making the best and most timely decision. To help with the pitfall that may occur in high school, I need to remain positive and seek the resources that will help me to do well and stay in school. Students should go to school and learn the school work. You should also do your homework and ask for help when needed. Students should go to their guidance counselors, or their teachers for additional help when necessary. Sometimes I feel uncomfortable asking for help. You need learn important skills like asking for help, talking with the teachers, being responsible and respecting to the teachers. These simple skills can help you to stay in school, do assignments and home work so you can get good grades, a good grade point average and meet all graduation requirements. You should stay in school, so that you can graduate with good grades and then go on to further your education. Failure to remain in high school will result in poor grades, poor skills. If this happens, you will not get good grades, skills or knowledge that will help you to become a good person in the community. Therefore it is important to stay in school, use the resources, avoid the pitfalls and make the best decisions to stay in school. Prompt: Evaluate a significant experience or achievement that has special meaning to you. Going to a different elementary school s every year or every other year wasn’t always easy. Living with that transition as a kid wasn’t easy at all to make friends. Events like birthday parties and having people over were always difficult to set up because I didn’t really have a group of base friends that I grew up with. Plus my parents are the type that they have to meet the others kids’ parents for me to even come to a sleepover. Imagine being eight years old , walking into a new elementary school , not knowing a face in the school with butterflies in your stomach wondering how it’s all going to turnout . That was me at least four different times back in my elementary days. I would say the hardest task was to try and fit in. Every day was a new challenge to face because everyone knew each other and it was like I was the only crumbled cookie in a fresh new pack of opened Oreos. My teacher did try and make it better by doing all the introductions and trying to fit me in but I was still the odd ball in the pack. Plus as a kid was very timid, some would say anti-social, so that definitely didn’t help me. Honestly sometimes I even tried not to make friends because I knew I was going to end up moving. Prompt: Greatest challenge I have ever faced Moving away from the place I was raised in and lived the most of my life was very hard for me and my family. It was scary, but at the same time it’s exciting to explore the new beginning of our life. My mind was thinking that if I move away from all my loved one and friends, I won’t be able to see them again and I’m afraid I won’t be able to make any new friends in United States. After living in the Philippines for almost Prompt: “Discuss what makes you uniquely qualified for college” College is the next essential step; it is also the most talked about after you finish high school. The reason college is known for being so hard is because high school graduates don’t really know what they want to be. People their age rarely know what they want to be. Myself I have spent countless hours discovering what I would like to accomplish. Anyone can say they want to do something; it takes some drive and execution to pursue something you enjoy. There are many cases where I could have quit and people would have loved to see me fail. At the end of all that I just had to remember why I was doing it, and was it worth fighting for. To prove them wrong I work hard for whatever it took a months or years. I just had to stay determined and put all my essential qualities to use. High School is a rough time for some students. Students are figuring out what they want to become and finding out who they are. 50% – 70% of students change their majors at least once; most will change majors at least 3 times before they graduate. Not only knowing what you want to do is important, finding out whom you are necessary as well. Why is this important as a college student? Many students when they get to college don’t have the hard work and will power to continue. Students don’t know what works for them to be successful. I have spent many methods on how to plan and make myself successful. Someone once told me that they’re a difference between listening and learning. Anyone can listen but only some can learn. It is the same concept on having idea/dream, and someone who peruses their aspirations. I had teachers before that told me that “You would not go anywhere”. The only thing the teachers didn’t know was I did not take their “advice” into consideration. I kept myself from going the wrong way. The steps I took were I did all I could do, and if I was failing behind I made up the work. I continuing doing well and showed my teachers wrong. I could have quit and not cared but I was motivated because I had a goal to achieve. Hard work over weights anything I notice that hard work is like practice. Everyone knows the saying that “Practice makes perfect”. No matter how bad you are at something the amount of time I’ve practice takes an effect. I have put so much hard work into school. That I’m ready for a new challenge college is that next step. I have prepared my whole life to get this opportunity. With all the knowledge I have learn from preparing and my high school practice college I am ready for college. With all the things I have learned during my school years and my life lessons. I have learn a lot of new thing and will look forward to learning new things in college. Prompt: “Describe an important transition in your life” It was my first year of high school. I was excited and nervous at the same time I was excited because it was a new beginning for me. It what significant to me because it was a big change for me. I was going from middle school to high school. The alarm goes off it is now 5:00 a.m. it is time for me to get ready for school. I get off my bed and go brush my teeth then go into in to the shower. The water was freezing cold. When I got out the shower I rushed to my room and start getting ready. The time flew by so quickly. I got ready on time. I had few minutes before I had to go to the bus stop. I ate some cereal before leaving. Once, I left to bus stop I was walking with my sister. I arrived at the bus stop it was near the road where the cars were passing. The wind was blowing in my face because of the cars racing in the road. I could see the red lights flashing on the bus. The bus is getting near I start shaking and my hands are getting sweaty. I get on the bus and it feels as if I was walking into an oven it was hot. Furthermore, we are getting near the school and I get afraid. I don’t know what is it like to be in high school and it will be a new experience for me. We finally arrive at school. There are many buses there also. Suddenly, they yell out “unload” when they say that it means to open the door and let us out of the bus. Everyone starts rushing off the bus and I am patiently waiting for my turn. I get off the bus and start walking into the school. I walk in the school and there are lots of people. I am squeezing in between the crowd. I finally walk through everyone and it is time to look for my classes. I think to myself I don’t know where my classes are the good thing is that there were teachers in mostly each corner. I got to all my classes. I would look around to see if I had any friends in that class. Luckily, I had at least one friend in each class. I just wanted the day to be over as soon as possible. The thing that got me nervous was that my sister would always tell me, “high school is not easy.” The first day isn’t that bad because the only thing we do is get informed of what we will expect and our expectations and what we will learn during the year. Additionally, for me the transition from middle school to high school was a big change for me. The reason being is because I was already getting use to walking up later like around 7:00 a.m. Then, the following year having to wake up at 5:00 a.m. was a change. I had to get use to waking up at that time. It was hard because the first days I would wake up at the right time then, I would go back to sleep. I missed the bus a few times. I managed to get over that with time. The only thing I didn’t like is that I had seven classes. The other thing was that the classes were very apart from each other. For example, I had to walk from one building to another one in five minutes. Overall, I liked all my classes. For me high school was easy as long as I did my work. They start getting us ready for college. Prompt: “Discuss the greatest challenge you have face or expect to face” Challenge? What is a challenge? It’s something that you have to accomplish or something you have to face. Well everyone has challenges. Small ones, big ones but I never thought I would face the biggest one ever. That is my dad death. I had no idea it was going to happen that fast. So that’s the biggest challenge I have to face in my life. It was so unexpected I have to face. My life has change since that day. It began on June 30, 2014 that afternoon. I was hanging out with my friend Stefany. It was a great day. She left to go home. I went inside to my room. Then my mom got a call from my aunt. She told her that my dad had passed away. She came to my room. She told me and my sister that my dad has passed away. When I heard the bad news tears where rolling down my face. I had to call my older brother to tell him the news. He answers and when I told him. He was like your lying I’m like no I’m not. It was grandma all over. We went to see him in the hospital. It was the hardest thing I have to face to see. I almost fell to the ground and one of my aunts caught me. All the family was full of sadness and we couldn’t accept it. Later on that week it was his funeral. It was on Wednesday July 2, 2014. In the memorial service we were crying our tears out. When my family saw him it was horrible that we have to see him like that. During the service the ladies sung this song call “Yo Te Extranare” which it means I’ll miss you. That song is a dialogue of me and my dad talking. Every time listen to that song I always cry and be in pain, because it reminds me of him. Ever since the funeral nothing would make be happy. On that Saturday that week. We had this church event which took place in the park that my dad would always take me. That was also the park behind where my grandma and dad work. That day memories just came to me and tears came out too. So I walk around and cry my eyes out. When I was walking around. My mom was telling the people from church that my dad died that week. And she also told them that I was the most effected about it. Anyways ever since my dad passed away my life change a lot. All my friends ask me how you can live life still without your dad. I’m like I just don’t think about as much. Ever since then I haven’t been the same girl that I used to be. My religious beliefs change and so has my personalities. I’ve suffering for my dad death and for something else I can’t say. Every time I’m going somewhere. Something always reminds me of him and my memories come back. Oh also when I go to my grandpa house. I always think my dad is going to be there even though I should know he’s not there. I just can’t accept that he’s gone. My family and my friends say “It’s okay  your dad is now in peace and not suffering”. I’m like “No now I’m the one suffering “. I wanted him to see me graduate and see I made it. He saw my brother graduate and now he won’t see me. He would always tell me when he was here. “Ya me voy a morir” Which means I’m going to die. I hated that he would always say that. I would tell him “Pa no tengas eso” which means “Dad don’t say that”. So my life has complete became a suffering life. As can be seen life is so short. I want to live my life. Since my dad is no longer here I want him to know I’m doing everything so I would be successful. I want to become a writer, singer, and also an actress. He’s the only person that supported me on what I wanted to do with my life. So when I become one of those dreams of mine. I own it all to my dad. He made me what I am now and I want to accomplish everything I need to do. Now I’m not suffering as much for his death because I know he’s not suffering. And soon I would be with him. So this was the greatest challenge I have to face and still facing. Prompt: What are the three specific things you plan to do in Florida? The three specific things I plan to do at Florida is focusing on class, basketball, and wanting on to become a more responsible person. I want to build the best educate for me. Be known as one of the best student –athlete who came to Florida State. To be known to teachers on my skills of focus. To be remember as an elite player that played the game. To be one of the best player on and off the court. My focus is coming to Florida with a good mindset. My study habits would be up to par while in the hot steaming room with no A/C. my sweat would fall off my forehead like bullet shells. As I try to write a perfect paper. As I am proof reading the paper for the professor to receive the fulfilling grade of success. As I’m done with my work for class I head to the gym with coach and the guys. As we practice on our plays for the games. While me and the team breathe hard with exhaustion. The coaches would let us take a break and drink a cold bottle of Gatorade. While we drink and take a break we discussed about getting the sunny beach college sate a championship. As we end practice I’ll go off campus to go work and find a way to stay productive. To stay on the right path and let others go on the wrong. As I drive on the smooth road with the bright glowing sun hits my face. I would go out to find a job and make some more money to pay for books and food to live on. Then after work I’ll go to the donation and give the clothes that I don’t wear any more. I would clean up the streets of Florida to help the community out with a place to claim for good and clean areas. Prompt: Evaluate a significant experience or achievement that has a special meaning to you. Many people have achieved different things in their lives. Some have achieved to get scholarships. Other where able to go pro in a sport they loved. There are a lot of achievements that people have been able to accomplish. A significant experience or achievement that has a special meaning to me is when I made it to Varsity Cross-Country. The first time that I joined Cross-Country I saw that there were many good runners. That inspired me to try to be the best runner for the team. I attended practice every day and gave it all I had. But one of my biggest obstacles that was stopping me from being the best was my knee pain. My knee pain was really bad and that was slowing me down big time. Therefore my sophomore season wasn’t the best; I wasn’t able to become the best runner for Berkmar. After I did therapy for my knee and I relaxed my joins I went back to running. But this time I did something different that I dint do the first time, I went to summer conditioning. Summer conditioning helped me out big time to become better and achieve my goal. I ran all summer long with the team; luckily I wasn’t having any knee pain. After summer conditioning finished our Cross-Country season started again. I was determined to achieve my goal that year. Two weeks into the season and we had our first race of the year. After getting an 18:29 for a 3.1 mile race I knew I was on track to achieving my goal. I kept working hard to get even better and by the time you know it I was top varsity for Berkmar High School. I finished that year with my best time of 17:52. This year I am setting a new goal. That goal is to beat my personal record that I set last year. I’m going to put even more work in and I’m going to try more hard to achieve that goal. I know that I focus on my goal I’ll be able to reach it. The goal I am setting for this season it to run a 17:00 flat or less if possible. My main goal that I had was been to become a varsity runner. That goal has been accomplished, now I have to set new goals so I can keep making accomplishments in life. A new goal I have is to beat my personal record of 17:52 and hopefully get a Cross-Country scholarship. Overall the achievement that has a special meaning to me is the fact I was able to become varsity for Berkmar High School. Prompt: ”Evaluate a significant experience or achievement that that has special meaning to you.” One of the greatest achievements is to graduate and fulfill all the dreams and goals that I have set for myself. This world is full of people that had set goals, and dreams but never did anything to make them come true. I don’t want to be one more of those people that don’t do anything to not make them; I will do whatever it takes just to make it happen. I want these not only for myself but I part for my family. They have been there sense day one and I appreciate all their support. Why do I say that I don’t only want it for me but for my family? Because, my family has been there for me without thinking about it twice, they have had my back, no matter what they will always be there. They push me to do my very best all the time, and tell me every time that I should never stop fighting for what I want, if I want it to go for it. Even when the get too pushy and very stressful I know they don’t do it to frustrate me they do it because they care and want me to do good in life and even though I feel like they pressure me sometimes I know it’s because they care. By me graduating and entering college, would be the best achievement ever not only because I prove myself that I could do but because I would be making my mom prude, and for all of those people that didn’t have faith in me or never believe that I could have done it. I want to give the best I have and be successful. My mother is one thing that push me the most to do good, and I want to make her proud and show her that I can do it, and by that I will be giving her back a little out of all that she has gave me. That is the main achievement that I have in mind, the one that is going to take me far in life the one that I’m going to be proud to say that I made it and that I did it all by myself, with hard effort but I made it. Everybody is born with a purpose in life, I know mine. Now the only thing I have left is to get to it and do anything it takes to get it done. Think of a place you know well. Describe the place and include feelings about it. Have you ever wanted to go back in time, and visit that one place that brings a smile to your face? Meanwhile that exact place is so far from your reach, and on the other hand it’s extremely close to your heart. When I think of that place I only imagine Guatemala. There are three areas in Guatemala that I enjoy tremendously which are in some ways very different and similar at the same time. Venecia, Guatemala is one of these areas that I adore to stay at. Primarily I’m fondled at the fact that my mom was born around this district. Also her parents and my grandparents still live there to this day. Every time I go spend time over there I fancy walking through the high stalks of green corn and getting lost for hours with my little cousin Yasmin. Another thing I’m delighted by is the morning breeze hugging my skin so tight that goose bumps appear throughout by body. Evenings were even better; my grandmother would stir up a cup of coco for my sister and me and included bread on the side to make the experience even more outstanding. I won’t ever forget the time when my sister and I put ten baby chicks in a circle and surrounded them with something. After a few seconds we would lift that something and the chicks would run in every direction. The place was to collect each one of the chicks until we got ten again. This specific moment made me feel butterflies and fireworks inside my tummy. Every single time I go to visit the moment is extremely pleasant and unforgettable. My heart speeds up every time I am able to go to Guatemala. Another place I’m exited in Guatemala to spend time at is chela. Chela is located near the city. It’s three hours from the city but a hot sweaty three hours in the car. My mom’s little brother Rudy lives there in a two story home. I love going there because I get to share moments with my baby cousin. I remember once my brother, sister and I went to a water park like thirty minutes away. My eyes almost popped out of my head once I saw the price of each ticket. Each one of us had to pay one hundred quetzals, which is the name of the currency in Guatemala. In U.S currency it would vary from fourteen to fifteen dollars. The money didn’t really bother me at the end of the day. I saw huge slide with people shouting and screaming. The one ride that is unforgettable to me was the one where all three of us got into one float and were pushed in a giant swirling slide and we at got wet and at the end of the slide was a pool where we fell into. My heart was racing the entire time we were there. After the water park we headed back to my uncle’s house where we ate a fish that was whole and looking at me. This started to make my stomach to move from the smile on my face. After a few weeks my other grandparents, my dad’s parents came to pick my sister and I up to go stay with them until the day we had to come back to Georgia. My father’s parents live the closest to the city. Its one and a half hours away. The interesting part of Chimaltenango, Guatemala is that it’s always mid-warm there and I love the sun beating against my skin. I adore helping out in my grandfather’s store where he basically sells everybody’s needs. The benefit of being his granddaughter was that I basically owned his store as well. What I mean by that was I could take anything and pig out on whatever I craved. Luckily that wasn’t the only thing to do at their house. At times I would help my grandma water all her crops such as bananas,plantans,mangos Prompt: A person that who has had a significant influence on you, and describe that influence. They say ‘Never Judge A book by Its Cover “, but why does everyone still judge me because of the carrier I want to take or the job I would love to have. People are always telling me what to do and what is best for me, but I don’t want what happen to my cousin happening to me. I really want to be a doctor’s assistants and I will be because I have the skills for it. My cousin always wanted to travel the world, but her parents never let her do what she wanted to do with her life, since they were the ones who were paying her college and her books. People and family members would always judge her because they thought she would never get to that level since most of us were poor. She knew that one day she was going to be traveling to many countries, and luckily the United States government sent a letter to her school asking for a voluntary helper to go to out the country and help others. When everyone doubt it her, she always believed in herself. From the time I was able to realize that the U.C (University Of California) was the best for me and my future, I decide to do my research on it. 2nd PeriodPrompt: Indicate a person who has had a significant influence on you, and describe that influence. Through out the good and the bad and the ugly she has been there. When i was sick feeling like i was on my death bed,she was there. When i just plainly need someone to talk to or a friend she was always there. That person is my mom. My mother has made the greatest influence on my life out of everyone i have know to this day. Throughout all the struggle she, me and my family as a whole she has been there and she was the one to keep it all together and kept a smile on her face even when she felt like she could just leave ,she stayed and fought through it all. She was my mother. My moms name is Yezzet Lewis Thomas. She is a Licensed Practical Nurses or LPN and she is working on her RN degree (Registered Nurses). Born in France moved to the United States when she was 2 and has 9 brothers and sisters her family was a military family with her dad serving in the military. One reason i chose her to be my biggest influence on me is the fact she was always there for me. when i was younger from Elementary to Middle school I had a really hard time making friends and had lots of issues with me being bullied and my constant stutter did not make it any better from my point of view, It just gave others more ammo to fire at me day after day and i struggled with life. But i always knew i could come home and wait to 8 o'clock the time she gets off of work and just talk to her about it like she was my best friend. She was always on my side and when i needed stuff done school wise she would stay up late to help me even if she had to go back to work at 6 in the AM. Describe an important transition in your life. My name was not called to participate in the 2014-2015 Peachtree Ridge, three day soccer tryouts. The coach said, “we do not have your physical on file”, but yet I turned mine in to the lady soccer adviser and she said she will put it in the day I gave it to her a week before. The JV coach told me to ask Coach Sutton, the Varsity coach, to see if I can still tryout. When I walked over to him, and informed him on the situation, he looked me up and down looking at how I was dressed, I am new to the soccer world so I had some; black vans, shorts and two hoodies on, that day was the day it started to snow, and he said, “well if it is not on file then I will not let you tryout.” I was outside for hours just practicing in the cold after school, from 2:10 to 5:00. Being told in front of the whole soccer team and new comers, that you can’t tryout, is embarrassing, and it really hurts you. I knew I turned in my Physical Form but they “did not have it”. Later on that day of the tryouts, my mom emailed Coach Sutton, and informed him that I did turn it in to the Soccer Lady. So the Coach replies saying that I am able to come to the second day tryout and I will be evaluated closely during the tryout. I told my mom no, I will not go to the tryout because I will feel the pressure and know they are watching me closely, I also did not want not meet their standers and still not make the team. Plus, I did not have much experience to the game of soccer, so I thought it would be best of me to not go and work on my skills for the game till next year. So from the day after the second tryout, I was practicing soccer left and right, outside working on ball control, my touches, juggling, and at parks working on my shooting. I have improved a lot from the tryouts. I am glad that I decided to go off and improve my skills, I am more confident to tryout now, but still will be nervous and feel the pressure. I moved schools my last year of high school, to Berkmar High school and I am trying out this year, I will be attending Conditioning, did not do it at Peachtree Ridge, but I will now. Seniors have to try out for Varsity and juniors too and then sophomores and freshman have to try out for JV. So I will be preparing myself for Varsity tryouts, and the Varsity Coach, is also my Psychology teacher. He knows I am trying out for soccer and has been informing me the updates on soccer. I got my physical done and now I am just getting myself ready for conditioning. My future career goals with soccer, is to make it to an MLS (Major League Soccer) Team. MLS is only teams held in The United States, so American Teams. I have a few teams in mind, for example; Orlando FC, New York City, New York City Red Bulls and LA Galaxy. In 2017, Georgia will have their own MLS team, I would like to try them out first. So ever since that day after tryouts, I have opened my mind to soccer, learned more about soccer and would to take it up a notch in my life. I may not be much good but all I can do from then and to the future is practice. Prompt: Discuss What Makes You Uniquely qualified for This Position Not everyone is qualified for every job or career. I know I have the potential to be a police officer. Wearing the blue is not the easiest or most popular position right now but I am motivated to do it. Having the dream is the first step to a goal. However, having certain capabilities is also key to success in performing specific tasks. I am very perceptive so I can notice elements that are out of the ordinary that may disrupt society and I also possess a sense of justice to act out this role. I can see myself right now in the uniform and looking out across the street. Perception is a necessary skill for all law enforcement. Without it, criminals would continue to wreak havoc and no one will be any the wiser. If a situation seems off, I will notice. I know the symptoms of being under the influence of hard drugs: drowsiness, hyperactivity, sweating, irritability, paranoia. Liars will not fool me either. I will note the delay and uncertainty in a person’s response and the many gestures that accompany deceit. Then I will politely ask for the truth. There is another sense that is required for this position. A sense of justice is a key component to upholding the law. The privilege of safeguarding other people can corrupt. Many act as if they are the rulers of the land but I would consider myself a servant of society. Abusing power is unthinkable to me. There are government workers who accept bribes and practice favoritism. I would treat all citizens as equals, not favoring the rich, a gender, or any particular ethnicity. This country is founded on principles of equality and should be enforced by only the fair-minded. Professions require a certain set of skills. Applicants that want to be police officers are weeded out first for the incapable. I have astute skills to notice illegal and abnormal activities and I also have a clear sense of justice. I know I will pass the training and perform well in the field. In the not too distant future, I will assist in keeping the country, the city, the people in uniform. Prompt: ? I was born in Guatemala. When I was about five years old my mother contacted some people and I’ve lived in Georgia ever since. Growing up was a real struggle. Bills were paid late, sometimes there was no dinner for me and my siblings, and eventually we would relocate to a different apartment. This happened several times until money was no longer an issue and we moved into a humble house. My brother had it the worst out of the three kids my mom had. There was always the language barrier, but he was lucky since the school actually bumped him up a grade. Even with all the stress he managed to graduate. My sister was a total different story, however. Greilyn was always involved in extracurricular activities, and throughout her high school years she had at least one Advanced Placement class. She would juggle sleep, homework, sports, and after school clubs all at once. She wasn’t able to attend college because she didn’t have legal papers at that time. My brother, my sister and I were able to get a worker’s permit two years ago and my sister and brother were able to get a stable job. Both Heber and Greilyn moved to Florida, my brother with his wife and my sister with her husband. Family problems arose back at home. When I was in seventh grade I started to miss a lot of days in school. Some teachers told me I wouldn’t get anywhere in life and that’s where I stopped caring about anything that had to deal with school. This was when life knocked the teeth straight out of my mouth. I would have mental breakdowns time after time. In the 10th grade, I barely passed the first semester and I failed four classes the second. When I got to my junior year in high school I realized how important school really was and I made a life plan to become a mechanical engineer. I moved to Florida with my sister for the first semester of 11th grade and that’s where I recovered my lost credits. I went from taking advanced classes to standard classes in less than a year. I didn’t give up there and I’m still here standing. I know my story is merely one of thousands, but nothing would mean more to me than being the first in my family to go to college and prove to myself that I am no failure. I have always believed that one cannot get back up if they have never fallen. I’m grabbing life by the horns and taming the raging beast. This is only the beginning, for one day I will also prove the world, and those who doubted me, that I  am a successful college graduate. As the window bust from the hard wind I Can feel the the heat rise as the flames spread extremely rapidly from the garage to the living room. The flames started in the garage it was caused by the wires in the walls the Fire department said it was an electrical fire. I can remember the harsh smell of wood burning that made my stomach ache. The heat of the fire felt liked when you open the oven after a long time of preheating. One of My Greatest challenges that I faces was my house burning to the ground in the spring of 2007. This experience Changed my life completely it showed me things about family and friends, Showed me to Value things more, but it also made life harder. It was 11:48Pm on a Wednesday night everybody was asleep except my brother he was up watching TV when he notice a burning smell coming from down stairs, he rushed to see where it was coming from when he notice the garage was in flames, He run upstairs panicking to wake everybody up. Once he thought everybody was up the flames was already spreading more and more. As we try and put on our shoes we hear window bursting one by one. We all rushed towards the front door were you could barely see anything because the house was filled with black smoke, as I inhaled the smoke I remember getting lite headed jumping out the fire. Then once everybody was out we notice my baby brother didn’t make it out. The fire man said it was too risky for anybody to go back in the house, even the fire marshal gave up on him. My older brother wasn’t going for it he broke loose from the fire man and ran fast thru the back yard to the back door and up the stairs as he heard my brother scream for help. He yells to my brother to just roll down the stairs. He rolls down the stairs and he and my baby brother jumped out the house together as soon as they jumped out the whole entire house collapse. My brother had 3rd degree burns in many places. They Fire department called him a miracle because they never seen somebody make it out a house like that. My family lost everything, 5 dogs all our clothes shoes furniture and pictures everything. At the end of the night we were placed in a hotel for those whom didn’t have a house. We stayed in a hotel for about 2 months until we finally moved back to Chicago for 2 months to stay with my grandma. After the fire everything was different crying myself to sleep every night waking up in tears having nightmares of that night, I felt like I was reliving it all over again night by night, Not going to school every day because we had no clothes or shoes. When my house burnt down I left my best friend she stayed in that neighborhood she was the only person to know and understand. At that time I didn’t care about school at all. Going to school and people asking about was the worst. People making fun of me because I didn’t have a house I hated school just because of that. Nobody could understand what I was going thru at a young age. Moving from hotel to hotel school to school I went to 5 different elementary schools a different school every year. Having to make new friends every year was hard being insecure of my situation to tell people was the hardest. I used to go to school just to go not even caring about it. Until my 5th grade year and I meet this teacher who was so cooled and I could talk to her bout everything and she made me realize school is what I need. She taught me I can just write my hurt and my problems out with poetry or just start writing when I’m upset. As time moved on things started getting better, we started getting our life back together. Started building a home back together getting everything back to normal, even though it was hard and we struggled but my mom always managed to get it done. We noticed family wasn’t always there for you when you need them. It was us by ourselves against everything all the problems with no help, even my mom mother wasn’t there after time went back. It showed us life can be gone in a blink of an eye. After that it made us stronger and closer as a family. It made us strive harder to get everything we wanted and once had because we lost it all in one night. It showed me that I need an education to be successful in order to get everything I want. Prompt: The lessons we take from failure can be fundamental to later success. Recount an incident or time when you experienced failure. How did it affect you, and what did you learn from the experience? High school is a great stepping ground for young adults to experience responsibility, freedom and to prepare themselves for college and the work field. Everyone makes mistakes but it’s up to you to correct them and better the situation. Having responsibilities is a huge thing to have. You always have to stay focused and on top of things. My freshmen year in high school I failed second semester Biology. I didn’t know how I was going to be able to make it up so that I could still graduate on time and have a good college look at me. I went to my counselor to ask her about any programs that the school offered for kids that failed classes. She offered me a chance to do a afterschool program called Credit Recovery. The program was $100 for two weeks and class was 3 hours long. Having to do Credit Recovery for those two weeks I still had to say on top of doing my classwork for school and working. Me failing Biology set me back but also made me realize how much school Is important to me and just how badly I wanted stay focused and do the right thing. Freedom can help or set you back in life, it’s up to you to keep everything in order and to still do what you’re supposed to do. For example wanting to go out with your friends, instead of studying for a quiz. I honestly think Prompt: Indicate a person who has had a significant influence on you, and describe that influence. From a young age my grandparents were always on my butt to go in a straight line, to stay focus, and to never do something I would regret in the future. My grandparents always had a huge influence in my life. To this day I can never be any more grateful to have them. The example they set is the example I want to set to the lower classmen. From 5 in the morning to 6 afternoons, Monday thru Friday they would come with tiredness written all over their face. Just knowing they’re busting their butts just so I can go to school and knowing I don’t have to worry about anything. Because of them I want to strive for success, I want to be someone with a doctor’s degree or a business degree, just something that they could be proud of. I was given an opportunity that wasn’t given to my grandparents and that was an education. I’ve face situations where dropping out was the easy way out, but why quit when I’m so close to getting a diploma, why quit on something my grandparents would be so happy about, why let them down, why not graduate so they can tell their friends and family that they raised a successful kid, a kid that didn’t give up. My grandparents would tell me “ if you want to be successful go for it, we would be by your side; nothing stopping you from being someone important in life.” It’s my senior year and its crazy to think that I made it this far, I’m the only one in my family that’s about to graduate, I’m breaking a curse that’s been in my family for generations. My grandparents are the reason for me to finish my education. Every day I would get lectured about what kind of life I would have if I don’t finish high school, I don’t want to be behind a lawn mower working 11 hours a day in the heat. Having an education open so many doors for different opportunities in the future. Prompt: Discuss the greatest challenge you have faced or expect to face Everyone has a challenge that they expect to face. My greatest challenge that I expect to face is going to college and being successful in the future. Those are my greatest challenge because it is not going to be easy. I am going to have to put a lot of effort and not mess up. Once you mess up it is very hard to get back up, and since it is about your future than it is very important to not make that mistake. It is not going to be easy because colleges do not just accept anybody. They require much information such as the SAT or the ACT. Which are a test that every college requires, and you have to meet the average point or above. Also a certain point of GPA and above, resume and other important requirements. College is the real thing, it is more freedom and that is where you already know what you want to do in life. You have your mind set on your career and at that moment you already know what you should do and expect to do. To be successful in my future I have to do something I enjoy doing and that gets me good money for it. I want to do entrepreneur, because I want to have my own business. I do not like it when people boss me around. Therefor if I study entrepreneur I would be the one bossing people around and they would work for me. I enjoy that because it something I like to do and I have always wanted to have my own business. In college I want to study entrepreneur, but it would not be easy. Even though it would not be easy I would not give up, it would be a great challenge for me. College is the time to get your things together and start working extra hard. It is not going to be easy but one should not give up. It would be extremely stressful and hard but that is just how college is. I am the type of person that gets distracted easily so I paying attention in college with no distractions would be a challenge. I would have to set up goals and learn how to accomplish each one of them. When you set up goals you have to be determined and find a way to achieve them. It is a lot to do but it is something I expect to face. Prompt: The greatest challenge I am expected to face. As a child I had almost everything handed to me. What I would ask for I received, I had six pets for crying out loud. As time prevailed getting what I wanted when I wanted wasn’t so easy anymore. Now it’s my last year of high school and it could not be any more stressful than it is now. It’s the last first day of high school I am struck with “senioritis” as soon as I walk through those double doors. Saying to myself “I can’t wait to graduate and get this year over with”. By May all of this will be over and I’ll be left to my own devices, by May all my friends would have moved on ,and I’ll be stuck thinking to my self what’s next? By May my time would be up Prompt: Discuss a place that has changed you. It’s a shame how few people choose not to go to college. I plan on going to college and have a bright future. One particular school I’ve been seeking is Morehouse. I plan on attending a school with a positive environment and fair rules. I have learned unique history and facts about the school as well. Not too long ago I visited Morehouse College my sophomore year. I was in this mentoring program called BEAMERS we went on a field trip to visit the school. This experience changed me. I remember stepping off that rusty bus into the quiet school. The halls were silent and echoed every step you took. The lunch room smelled like a 5-star restaurant. I said to myself: “I’d love to attend this school”. As soon as we made it to the college we sat in a class room then talked to a student that attends Morehouse. He told us the GPA requirements, which was a 3.7 at the time. He explained Morehouse is a private, four-year, historically black college. We were also informed that Morehouse was an all-male school. This statement was a shock to many including myself. The crazy thing was Spelman College was right across the street from Morehouse. Spellman was an all-female school. The student informed us with much information about the school but our tour was nowhere finished. The best part about our tour was coming up next. The student informed us with unique history of the school. There is an obelisk named in honor of Howard Thurman. Thurman was an African American author, philosopher, theologian, educator and civil rights leader. He was a graduate of Morehouse College. There were many other celebrities that graduated from this school such as Spike Lee, Samuel L. Jackson, and Martin Luther King Jr. Martin Luther King was enrolled at more at the age of 15 after skipping the 9th & 12th grade. These unique facts went on and on like a broken record. Ever since the Morehouse tour I’ve never been the same. I met the requirements to this college. I would be more than happy to attend it. I hope ever school high school gets to tour this college. It is truly a life changing experience. Prompt: Discuss the greatest challenge you have faced or expect to face. Throughout my entire life challenges have been with me from the beginning. No matter what I have faced challenges and been expecting to face more that are thrown my way. Without dealing with these situations in life I don’t think I would be as successful as I am now. Challenges to me are basically things to where I have to push myself in order to go where I want to go. Plus learning how to never give up and stay at the task at hand. The greatest challenge I expect to face in life is getting my mom and brother a bigger house and a better lifestyle for them. I really expect to do all that through basketball as a matter of fact and I have a great feeling that I will be able to accomplish this as well. Basketball is really my wife in this w"

80,Bob Dylan,Tangled up in Blue,"Early one morning the sun was shining I was laying in bed Wondering if she'd changed at all If her hair was still red Her folks they said our lives together Sure was going to be rough They never did like Mama's homemade dress Papa's bankbook wasn't big enough And I was standing on the side of the road Rain falling on my shoes Heading out for the East Coast Lord knows I've paid some dues Getting through Tangled up in blue  She was married when we first met Soon to be divorced I helped her out of a jam, I guess But I used a little too much force We drove that car as far as we could Abandoned it out West Split up on a dark sad night Both agreeing it was best She turned around to look at me As I was walking away I heard her say over my shoulder ""We'll meet again someday On the avenue"" Tangled up in blue  I had a job in the great north woods Working as a cook for a spell But I never did like it all that much And one day the ax just fell So I drifted down to New Orleans Where I lucky was to be employed Working for a while on a fishing boat Right outside of Delacroix But all the while I was alone The past was close behind I seen a lot of women But she never escaped my mind And I just grew Tangled up in blue  She was working in a topless place And I stopped in for a beer I just kept looking at the side of her face In the spotlight, so clear And later on, when the crowd thinned out I was just about to do the same She was standing there, in back of my chair Said to me ""Tell me, don't I know your name?"" I muttered something underneath my breath She studied the lines on my face I must admit, I felt a little uneasy When she bent down to tie the laces Of my shoe Tangled up in blue  She lit a burner on the stove And offered me a pipe ""I thought you'd never say hello"" she said ""You look like the silent type"" Then she opened up a book of poems And handed it to me Written by an Italian poet From the thirteenth century And every one of them words rang true And glowed like burning coal Pouring off of every page Like it was written in my soul From me to you Tangled up in blue  I lived with them on Montague Street In a basement down the stairs There was music in the cafes at night And revolution in the air Then he started into dealing with slaves And something inside of him died She had to sell everything she owned And froze up inside And when it finally, the bottom fell out I became withdrawn The only thing I knew how to do Was to keep on keeping on Like a bird that flew Tangled up in blue  So now I'm going back again I got to get to her somehow All the people we used to know They're an illusion to me now Some are mathematicians Some are carpenter's wives Don't know how it all got started I don't know what they're doing with their lives But me, I'm still on the road A-heading for another joint We always did feel the same We just saw it from a different point Of view Tangled up in blue"

Do you hope to pluck this dusky jewel?  Hello, Hello, Hello, Hello, Hello, Hello, Hello I want you Hello I need my baby Hello, Hello, Hello, Hello..."

119,Eagles,One of These Nights - 2013 Remaster,"CHAPTER III THE TRAITS AND PRACTICE OF VAMPIRISM IT was generally supposed that all suicides might after death become vampires; and this was easily extended to those who met with any violent or sudden death. Mr. Lawson tells us that there persists a tradition in Maina, where the Vendetta is still maintained, that a man whose murder has not been avenged is liable to become a vrykolakas. The Mainotes who derive their name from the place Maina, near Cape Taenaron (Matapan), even yet preserve many of the customs and characteristics of their ancestors, and historically are known to be of a more pure Greek descent than the inhabitants of any other district. Indeed, the peninsula which thrusts into the sea the headland of Taenaron has both social and religious customs of its own. The population is distributed into small villages, while here and there a white fortress will denote the residence of a chief. A traveller writing in 1858, remarks: ""The Maina country is wild and beautiful, singularly well cultivated, considering the difficulties to be surmounted, and producing crops that put to shade the rich plains of Argos and Arcadia; whilst the interesting mountain people exercise the highland virtues of hospitality and independance to an extent unknown in the low countries."" It has been said that the last traveller who saw Maina while retaining some remains of its primitive cateran glories was Lord Carnarvon, who in 1839 explored the Morea and has left us an extraordinarily interesting account of his journey. The population of this district continued the worship of the Pagan deities for full five hundred years after the rest of the Roman Empire had embraced Christianity, and they were not finally converted until the reign of the vigorous Emperor Basil I, 867-886. Gibbon described them as ""a domestic and perhaps original race, who, in some degree, might derive their blood from the much-injured Helotes."" And even yet p. 141 they boast of their descent from the ancient Spartans, whilst the histories of Leonidas and Lycurgus, who figure partly as saints and partly as gallant brigands, are still retold round the winter fireside. The whole district, including Kaka Voulia (the Land of Evil Counsel), is formed by the hummocks and escarpments of Mount Taygetos, and, with the exception of a long strip of coast line, which the Venetians called Bassa Maina, it is steep and hilly and for the most part barren. The conquest of the Morea was completed by Mahomet II in 1456-1460, but Maina could never be thoroughly subdued, and its inhabitants remained as entirely independent as were the Highlanders before Culloden. As has been remarked, ancient traditions still persevere, and among these customs not the least obstinate is the Vendetta. A man who has been murdered is unable to rest in his grave until he has been avenged. Accordingly he issues forth as a vampire, thirsting for the blood of his enemy. In order to bring about his physical dissolution and to secure his repose it is necessary for the next of kin to slay the murderer, or at least some near relative of the murderer. Unless this is done the man upon whom the duty of avenging blood devolves is banned by the curse of the dead, and if so be that he is himself cut off before he can satify the desires of the deceased, the curse will yet cling to him even in death, and he too must become a vampire. It should be remarked that this view of blood-guilt is found in the Attic dramatists, and is in fact the mainspring of the whole story of Orestes. In the tragedy of this name by Euripides, Tyndareus, the father of Clytemnestra, remonstrates very reasonably, and indeed unanswerably with Orestes. But the hero replies and argues that if he has not avenged his father Had not his hate's Erinyes haunted me? Again in the Choephoroe of Aeschylus Orestes pursues the same idea saying that unless he avenges his father, a stern duty which has devolved upon him, lie will be punished in turn by the avengers of his father's wrongs. It may be remarked that in Maina to-day no recourse must be had to law for such cases, nor must the injured person satisfy himself by calling upon the aid of the police. To do this were incredibly base, the subterfuge of a recreant and a craven. Even if it be a life's whole work a man is expected, either secretly p. 142 or by an open attack, to slay the murderer of his relative, and he is highly applauded when he has accomplished this pious deed. It must be appreciated that he is regarded as herein directed and inspired by the dead man who returns from his grave as a vampire craving for blood. Even if no other motive or incentive prevailed, in spite of natural shrinking and may be even cowardice, a man would undoubtedly prefer to shed blood for blood, especially when this might be done in secrecy or by craft, rather than run the terrible risk of himself becoming a vampire, finding no rest in the grave, but returning to haunt and persecute even those who were most dear to him, an unclean thing accursed. of God, a foul goblin of dread most hateful to man. So great is the horror which the act of suicide, although considered admirable in the decadence of Greece and Rome, inspires in every man of sane mind that it, is not at all surprising it should be deemed that the unfortunate wretches who have destroyed themselves become vampires after death. According to the Zoroastrian creed, suicide is a most fearful crime, and is classed among the marg-arzan, the abominable offences. Aristotle in his Ethics, V, xv, terms suicide a sin against the State, and as Cicero tells us Pythagoras forbade men to depart from their guard or sentry-go in life without an order from their commanding-officer, who is God. ""Uetatque Pythagoras iniussu imperatoris, id est, dei, de praesidio et statione uitae decedere."" (De Senectute, XX, 73). The highest pagan argument against suicide will be found in Plato's Phaedo (61E-62E), but it is drowned in the mighty voice of the great Saint of Hippo, which peals in no unwavering tones down the centuries: ""For if it be not lawful for a private man to kill any man, however guilty, unless the law have granted a special allowance for it, theft surely whosoever kills himself is guilty of homicide: and so much the more guilty doth that killing of himself make himself, by how much the more guiltless he was in that cause for which he killed himself. For if the act of Judas be worthily detested, and yet the Truth saith, that by hanging of himself, he did rather augment than expiate the guilt of his wicked treachery, because his despair of God's mercy in his damnable repentance, left no place in his soul for saving repentance; how much more ought he to p. 143 forbear from being cause of his own death, that hath no guilt in him worthy of such a punishment as death; for Judas in hanging himself, hanged but a wicked man and died guilty, not only of Christ's death, but of his own also; adding the wickedness of being his own death, to that other wickedness of his, for which he died."" (De Ciuitate Dei, I, xvii.) It may be well very briefly to present the teaching of the Church concerning positive and direct suicide. If done without God's permission this always constitutes a grave injustice towards Him. To destroy a thing is in effect to dispose of it as an absolute master and to act with regard to it as one who has full and independent dominion over it. But God has reserved to Himself dominion over life. Man cannot create life, and he does not possess this full and absolute right over his own life. Consequently suicide must be reckoned as an attempt against the dominion and right of ownership of the Author of life. To this injustice is super-added a serious offence against the charity owed by man to himself, since by self-murder he deprives himself of the greatest good in his possession. Moreover this sin may be aggravated by other circumstances, such as an offence against conjugal, paternal, or filial duty; an offence against justice or charity; if by taking his own life a man eludes existing obligations of justice or acts of charity which he could and should perform. That suicide is unlawful is the general teaching of Holy Scripture which condemns the act as a most terrible crime, and to arouse the horror of all against Holy Church denies the suicide the rites of Christian burial. Again, suicide is directly opposed to the most natural and powerful tendency of all created things, and especially of intelligent man, the preservation of life. Indeed very large numbers of physicians, moralists, and jurists lay it down as a general rule that suicide is always due to dementia, so great is the horror which this atrocious deed inspires in every man of sane mind. As a generalization this may be admitted to be true, for it is impossible to think that those who have the calm and right use of their reason should deliberately destroy themselves, and the conditions which are necessary to incur the full culpability of an act can only in exceptional instances be conceived of as being present in the case of a suicide. Sabetti inquires: ""Quaenam ad peccatum mortale p. 144 requirantur?"" And his answer is given as follows: ""Tria necessario requiruntur, scilicet materia grauis uel in se, uel ob circumstantias; aduertentia plena ad malitiam grauem actus; consensus plenus uoluntatis in præuaricationem. Itaque, Requiritur 1°. materia grauis, secus non posset haberi lex obligans sub graui. Requiritur 2°. plena aduertentia mentis, secus non habebitur plena deliberatio. Requiritur 3°. plenus consensus uoluntatis, quia nisi peccator cum pleno consensu plenaque deliberatione obiectum peccati Deo præferat, et sic finem suum ultimum in creatura constituat, nequit dici a Deo totaliter recedere. Insuper a bonitate diuina prorsus alienum est, hominem æternæ damnationi addicere siue propter transgressionem leuem siue propter actum non perfecte liberum et uoluntarium.--Cf. S. Alphons, nn. 5, 6 et 53."" The Christian Middle Ages were free from the terrible tendency of suicide, but with the loss of Faith it re-appeared, and Masaryk in his study Der Selbstmord als sociale Massenerscheinung der modernen Civilisation (Vienna, 1881), considered it to be the special evil of these later days. Sad to relate self-destruction has fearfully increased since the Great War, but it may perhaps be mitigatingly advanced that the reason of the world tottered almost to eternal delirium during the chaos and welter of blood, and the balance is not recovered yet. It is true that among certain nations there appears to be an indifference to human life, nay, a contempt of death itself, which often takes the most extravagant and the most outrageous forms. The Goths, the heathen Vandals, and Norse savages not only approved but sought suicide and violent death. It is, of course, only among the utterly benighted that it is possible for such abominable ideas to obtain. For example, there existed among a tribe of robbers in Southern India customs of the utmost ferocity. Such practices as the following certainly prevailed during the eighteenth century, but they have no doubt, long since been happily suppressed. If two persons had quarrelled, sometimes for the most trifling reasons, a man would kill himself merely in order to be revenged on his adversary. He believed that p. 145 his ghost would be able to return and harry the surviver , or at least that some dire retribution must fall on the head of his enemy who drove him to such extreme measures. Again, custom required that if a man committed suicide, letting it be known that it was on this account, the person with whom he had had the difference that led to this abominable act must immediately follow his example. Lord Avebury's statement: ""It is said that in China, if a rich man is condemned to death, he can sometimes purchase a willing substitute at a very small expense,"" has been traversed and Professor Parker would not commit himself any further than by saying: ""It is popularly stated that substitutes can be bought for Taels fifty, and most certainly this statement is more than true, so far as the price of human life is concerned; but it is quite another question whether the gaolers and judges can always be bribed."" Dr. W. T. A. Barber, who had been a missionary in China, relates that he had known very large numbers of persons who committed suicide out of spite against some one else, ""the idea being, first, the trouble given by minions of the law to the survivor; second that the dead would gain a vantage ground by becoming a ghost, and thus able to plague his enemy in the flesh."" It is not surprising to learn that in ancient times, before the advent of Christianity, among such savage people as the Celts and the Thracians suicide was not only common but treated with the most appalling lightness and even flippancy. Thus Athenæus, speaking of the banquets of the Thracians, quotes from Seleueus as follows: ""And Seleueus says, 'that some of the Thracians at their drinking parties play the game of hanging; and fix a round noose to some high place, exactly beneath which they place a stone which is easily turned round when any one stands upon it; and then they cast lots, and he who draws the lot, holding a sickle in his hand, stands upon the stone, and puts his neck into the halter; and then another person comes and raises the stone, and the man who is suspended, when the stone moves from under him, if he is not quick enough in cutting the rope with his sickle, is killed and the rest laugh, thinking his death good sport.'"" Upon the authority of the famous Stoic philosopher, Posidonius, Athenæus tells us of similar brutalities which took place among the Celts. He writes: ""But Posidonius, in the p. 146 third, and also in the twentieth book of his Histories, says 'The Celtæ sometimes have single combats at their entertainments. For being collected in arms, they go through the exercise, and make feints at, and sometimes they even go so far as to wound one another. And being irritated by this, if the bystanders do not stop them, they will proceed even to kill one another. But in olden times,' he continues, 'there was a custom that a hind quarter of pork was put on the table, and the bravest man took it; and if any one else laid claim to it, then the two rose up to fight, till one of them was slain. And other men in the theatre having received some silver or gold money, and some even for a number of earthen vessels full of wine, having taken pledges that the gifts promised shall really be given, and having distributed them among their nearest connexions, have laid themselves down on doors with their faces upwards, and then allowed some bystander to cut their throats with a sword.' ""And Euphorion the Chalcidian, in his Historical Memorials, writes as follows: 'But among the Romans it is common for five minæ to be offered to any one who chooses to take it, to allow his head to be cut off with an axe, so that his heirs might receive the reward: and very often many have returned their names as willingly, so that there has been a regular contest between them as to who had the best right to be beaten to death.'"" These atrocious examples serve to show us something of the evil and the corruption of which Christianity cleansed the pagan world, although it is to be feared that the battle is not yet won, since it is a notorious and deplorable fact that at the hour of such a crisis as the Great War the respect due to human life became cheapened in men's eyes, with the consequence that murder and deeds of violence once more broke out in every direction showing that savage instincts were dominated indeed, but in many cases not wholly eradicated. It does not require a keen perception to see the direct agency of the devil here, and these atrocities which bred so callous and cruel a spirit are by no means altogether unconnected with the recrudescence of necromancy and black magic which foul arts once more grew green and were almost openly pursued on every side. The belief that a man has not complete dominion over his own life and that it is unlawful for him to take it is certainly a p. 147 feeling naturally implanted in the human breast, and it was only when nations were entirely barbarian or had became decadent and corrupt that the notion of suicide was held up as noble and even heroic. Whatever certain among the later Greeks may have practised and taught, in earlier days, as we have seen, the act of suicide was regarded as a dark and presumptuous deed. They truly felt that there was in it something of ἀσέβεια, something of that ὕβρις which so surely stirred the wrath of heaven and inevitably called down righteous vengeance. Indeed the evil and malice of suicide did not end with death but continued beyond the grave. The umbra of a man who had slain himself was dreaded and feared. So in ancient Athens it was the custom to cut off the hand of a suicide and to cremate it or at least to bury it far from his body, the object of such mutilation being to prevent his ghost from attacking the living. Similar beliefs exist among native African tribes. Thus the Wajagga of East Africa dread the spectres of suicides. When a man has hanged himself a certain complicated ceremonial becomes imperative. They take the rope from his neck and suspend a goat in the noose, after which the animal is swiftly slain. The idea seems that hereby the phantom will be in some way appeased, and he will not be so likely to tempt human beings to follow his evil example. The Baganda of Central Africa have an even greater horror of the ghosts of suicides, and the most elaborate precautions are invariably taken to protect themselves against these dangerous visitors. The body of a man who has destroyed himself is removed as far from all human habitation as possible, to waste land or to a cross-road, and there is utterly consumed with fire. Next the wood of the house in which the horrid deed has been done is burned to ashes and scattered to the winds; whilst if the man has hanged himself upon a tree this is hewn to the ground and committed to the flames, trunk, roots, branches and all. Even this is hardly deemed to be sufficient. Curiously enough there is a lurking idea that the ghost of a suicide may survive after the cremation of the body, so horrible is this crime felt to be and so irradicated the taint that this terrible deed establishes. This is extremely significant since the cases in which cremation, a complete purgation and destruction by fire, cannot obliterate guilt and p. 148 destroy the evil infection are indeed exceptional, and it might be no easy task to find a parallel instance. However, the Baganda when passing by the spot where the body of a suicide has been burned always take good care to pelt it with sticks and clods of earth to prevent the ghost from catching them. Although these places in particular are dangerous to the last degree, there are other graves that may be haunted by phantoms, which as they have no bodies are not strictly vampires, but which certainly belong to the vampire family. Such are those remote places where persons who have been accused of black magic and who failed to satisfy the ritual ordeals have been burned to death, as also those spots where persons of evil and atrocious life have been cremated or interred. The Maraves, a tribe of South Africa, who also burned witches alive, whenever they had occasion to pass the place of doom, pelted it with stones, and it is said that in some instances of spots considered particularly ill-omened a regular cairn or tumulus of loose stones has arisen."" In Madagascar too, certain solitary graves bear an exceedingly ill-repute, so that the chance traveller with averted face throws stones at them or large lumps of earth in order to prevent the ghost following in his tracks and seizing on him. It must be remarked, and this is very important, that the sticks and stones, or heavy clods of earth with which a grave is pelted are not meant merely as a symbolical insult and expression of righteous indignation, but are actually missiles which will strike and hurt the being who haunts the spot of interment. So since the haunter can be struck and injured by these very material objects,--the heavier they are the better,--he must himself possess a certain concrete substantiality, and inasmuch as objects make an impression upon him he must exist under some kind of physical condition. Doubtless the exact idea is not very clearly defined in the minds of those who are so careful to pelt the grave, yet if stones will not merely ward off an attack from the haunter, but when in the course of time they become piled up into a small cairn they serve to keep the deceased in his place, that is to say in the grave, there must be some sort of material entity which can be so materially frustrated and obstructed. Here then we have the essential and complete vampire. It is recorded by a traveller about the middle of the last p. 149 century that when he was journeying in company with two Mussulmans from Sidon to Tyre, as he drew near the latter city he noticed a great pile of stones by the wayside, whereupon his companions began to pick up all the loose pebbles that came to hand and discharged them violently at the heap at the same time uttering the most fearful imprecations. When they had passed and were at some little distance they explained that a notorious brigand, whose hands were stained with the hideous cruelties and innocent blood, had been slain there, and buried on the spot half a century before. The stones they threw and their curses were directed against this villain. It might be thought in this case that the missiles were a mark of loathing and contempt, but it seems far more probable that they were intended to serve a very utilitarian purpose, that is actually to keep off the wretch who would still be haunting the pit into which his body had been cast fifty years since. It even appears that in many parts of Syria when brigands are killed by the highway, or vagrom murderers are dispatched in the open country side beyond the walls of a city the body is left to rot unburied where it lies, and after a while it is merely covered over with a heap of stones; moreover everyone who passes by is bound to quoit a stone or stick to add to the pile under the penalty of incurring some dreadful misfortune. It is supposed that heaven will horribly curse the person who fails to throw his flinty tribute as he goes. It is not only among rude African tribes and in the East that the graves of persons who have led cruel and anti-social lives, particularly the spots where suicides have been buried, are thus places of execration and fear, but in Pomerania and in West Prussia, not to instance many other districts, the spots where persons who have wrought their own destruction happen to be interred are regarded as unlucky in the highest degree, and there is no more malevolent and harmful spectre than the suicide's ghost. A man who has destroyed himself must not defile God's acre, in no wise may he be buried in the churchyard but at the place where the desperate deed was done, and everybody who passes by will cast a stone on the spot unless he wishes the ghost of the suicide to plague him nightly and to give him no rest until he is driven to the same dreadful fate. It is said that, as in Africa piles of sticks p. 150 and stones accumulate to a great size, so similar cairns rise upon these haunted spots in the more remote districts along the cold shores washed by the Baltic Sea. It is not surprising to find that in a country such as Russia, which through the ages has so often tottered to madness and of late years fallen into stark lunacy, during the seventeenth century an epidemic of suicide raged. It persisted, indeed, at spasmodic intervals throughout the eighteenth and even the nineteenth centuries, but it was somewhat earlier than this that the troubles of that luckless nation blazed out in furious frenzy. As when the year 1000 approached a fearful apocalyptic mania inflamed many parts of Europe, and men imagining that the world was about to come to an end, that almost any hour, any moment the Angel's clarion would blare, heaven and earth shrivel like some parching scroll and the Judge be set on His awful throne, in their hundreds deserted cities and homes to wander abroad preaching fevered repentance and the most extravagent forms of penance, or else in frantic despair abandoned themselves to debauchery and violence, so in Russia some mad visionary who proclaimed that the crack of doom was appointed for the year 1666 set the whole country aflame with terror. In many parts, men ceased to labour in the fields, relinquished their businesses and all social intercourse, barricaded themselves in their houses behind closed windows and fast-barred doors, awaiting the end with the gloomiest forebodings. As might have been expected, great numbers completely lost their senses and scores of dangerous lunatics not only infested the highroad but even invaded villages and towns preaching that the only way to escape the wrath to come was to prevent the final day by self-destruction. They were, moreover, very willing and eager to help those who shrank from so severe a test, and before long red murder was rife in every direction. Their services, however, were not required as frequently as might have been supposed for the delirium spread with such alarming rapidity that not merely households but whole communities eagerly devoted themselves to death. If in some paroxysm of wild hysteria a man had declared his intention of becoming a martyr, for so these poor wretches were deemed, the pious duty devolved upon his friends and relations of seeing that he scrupulously fulfilled his vow. Should he p. 151 wish to change his mind or in any way seek to escape his fate he was pursued and saved in spite of himself by being put to death in the most atrocious torments. A veritable reign of terror ensued, and northern Russia seemed well-nigh depopulated. It were superfluous to enter into the horrible details, but it may suffice to say that at first starvation was the usual method by which these maniacs committed suicide. In the forest of Vetlouga, one fanatic at huge expense actually built a tower without doors and windows, into the body of which persons were lowered through a trap in the roof. But this was too long a process; it gave space for reflection and with the pangs of hunger reason resumed her sway. Those within yelled to be released, but all in vain. To shouts and clamour succeeded groans and fainter lamentations, until as the days passed all was still. Another remedy was found and presently the method which was preferred and which was officially prescribed as safer and more pleasing to God was immolation by fire. Accordingly, the missionaries of this horrible impiety proclaimed safety through the flame; as the prophet Elias had ascended to heaven in a blazing chariot, so the deluded wretches were taught they would ascend to a glorious and delightful eternity from the midst of the conflagration. Hundreds and even thousands perished in huge holocausts. Whole areas were strictly enclosed, the candidates took their places therein and the compound having been previously drenched with pitch, bitumen, and inflammable oils torches were applied at many points. If any overcome by agony escaped with scorched and blackened limbs they were caught and hurled back into the heart of the pyre. These immolations generally took place during the dark winter season and from midnight until the faint streaks of dawn the red glow of these horrid furnaces could be seen in every direction. For hundreds of verstas the land became a veritable Tophet. As the morning broke, hordes of wolves attracted by the stench of roasting flesh assembled to pull trunks and limbs from the embers; a dark cloud of suffocating smoke, greasy with human fat that fouled both ground and houses, hung low in the sky, and ere many days were past the plague was stalking abroad with fatal voracity. It was not until the most vigorous measures had been taken that these terrible practices could be checked, and it seems that the p. 152 venom of the madness persisted long and late, for as recently as 1860, fifteen persons in the district of Olonetz committed suicide by fire, whilst during the winter of 1896-1897, twenty-four religious fanatics buried themselves alive in a pit near Tiraspol. The monk, Falaley, constantly preached that death was man's only means of salvation and that he must have done with this life of sin. One night under his influence, eighty-four persons congregated near the river Perevozinka and began to pray. Many of them were already half-crazed through excessive fasting, and they almost covered themselves with brambles and brushwood to which fire was to be set at a given signal. A woman, taking alarm at the thought of so horrible a death, escaped and informed the authorities. When the police arrived the fanatics shrieked that Antichrist was approaching, and setting fire to the pile most perished in the flames. A few who were rescued received sentences of imprisonment and deportation, but a fanatic called Souchkoff, managed to escape and continued to preach the gospel of death. Maddened by his doctrine in one locality alone, sixty families resolved to commit suicide at a certain moment, and a peasant, named Petroff, entering a neighbour's house cut down his wife and children with a hatchet. In a barn hard by, a dozen men with their wives had assembled and amid hymns of triumph they laid their heads upon an improvised block to be hacked off by Petroff. In another hut a woman and three children were dispatched at their own earnest request. At length when he was weary, Petroff himself kneeled down and was slain by Souchkoff. Between 1860 and 1870, a maniac named Chadkin, proclaimed that Antichrist was here, and all most follow him to the forests and there die of hunger. A large number assembled and his most devoted followers saw to it that nobody could escape. After a few days the sufferings of the crowds were fearful and the place rang with their screams and groans. Nevertheless Chadkin and his apostles did not waver. When some poor creature, frantic with agony, managed to break away and informed the police, the devotees at once began to kill all who had gathered together, and by the time the authorities had arrived in the utmost haste there were found but three survivors. Buddhist monks in China are often recorded to have p. 153 sought their Nirvana through an act of self -immolation by fire, and it is said that every year among the lamaresais of Tien-tai, in the province of Tai-chow, some half-a-dozen bonzes thus devote themselves to death. These unfortunate persons believe that their voluntary destruction crowns the monastery with honours and blessing, they are aware that they will be worshipped after their suicide, and they suppose that they will become the divinities of the district and possess the power to protect the whole neighbourhood, to grant fair weather and lucky seasons, a bounteous harvest and all prosperity. Such public incinerations are conducted with great ceremony, and take place upon a major festival which is bound to attract crowds of pilgrims and reverent suppliants to the spot. It is said that among the Eskimo of Bering Strait a sorcerer has been known to burn himself alive, fully believing that thus he will return to life as a shaman with much greater powers and a far fuller knowledge of magic than he had hitherto enjoyed. It may be remembered that even such low motives as vanity and a craving for mere notoriety have proved an incentive sufficiently powerful to induce men to seek a dramatic, if painful death by fire. Thus the charlatan Peregrinus after a career of the most braggart ostentation courted undying fame by self-immolation upon a pyre at the Olympic festival, which extraordinary performance attracted throngs not only of sensible persons who despised and mocked him but of encomiasts and apologists who regarded him as at the least a hero, if not something nearly approaching to deity. It can hardly be argued that higher motives inspired Empedocles if the account preserved by Diogenes Laertius to which Horace makes reference be true, namely that hoping by a sudden disappearance he might be accounted a god, the philosopher flung himself into the crater of Mount Aetna, but that the suicide was revealed owing to the fact that the volcano almost immediately after threw up one of his sandals, and thus betrayed the manner of his death. Josephus states that the Jews used not to bury the bodies of those who had destroyed themselves until after sunset. In Scotland it is still thought that the body of a suicide will not fall to dust until the time when he should have died in the order of nature, and it is very generally held that a such p. 154 a one must be buried with the grave facing north and south. This belief also existed in England and there are graves facing north and south to be seen at Cowden (Kent) and Bergholt (Suffolk), which are locally said to be those of persons who have destroyed themselves, for it is almost universally declared that Christian burial should be with the head in west, looking eastward. As is well-known, in England until the time of George IV, it was the general practice to bury suicides at the cross-roads, where a stake was driven through the body. In the year 1823, it was enacted that the body of a suicide should be buried privately between the hours of nine o'clock and twelve at night with no religious ceremony. In 1882, this law was altered, and the body may now be committed to the earth at any time and with such rites or prayers those in charge of the funeral think fit or may be able to procure. In certain country places it is still supposed that the spirit of the last person buried in a graveyard has to keep watch lest any suicide should be interred there. One explanation of the reason why persons who had taken their own lives should be buried at the cross-roads was that the ghosts of murdered persons were supposed to walk until the bodies had been recovered and committed to the churchyard with Christian rites, and since this was impossible in the case of suicides, a stake was driven through them when deposited at the cross-roads in order to keep the ghost from wandering abroad. It is certain that the idea here is the same as that of driving a stake through the vampire, for sometimes this precaution was taken in the case of persons who might perchance become vampires, an operation performed not as an indignity but as a preventitive. Burchard of Worms tells us: ""Cum aliquis, femina parere debit, et non potest, in ipso dolore si mortem obierit, in ipso sepulchro matrem cum infante palo in terram transfigunt."" And again: ""Fecisti quod quaedam mulieres instinctu diaboli facere solent, cum aliquis infans sine baptismo mortuus fuerit, tollunt cadauer paruuli, et ponunt in aliquo secreto loco, et palo corpusculum transfigunt, dicentes, si sic non fecissent, quod infantulus surgeret et multos laedere posset."" The reason for the selected spot of the suicide's grave being a cross-road is further explained by the belief that when the ghost or the body issues from the grave and finds that there p. 155 are four paths stretching in as many directions he will be puzzled to know which way to take and will stand debating until dawn compels him to return to the earth, but woe betide the unhappy being who happens to pass by when he is lingering there perplexed and confused. Accordingly after sunset, every sensible person will avoid all crossroads since there are no localities more certainly and more fearfully haunted and disturbed. It will readily be remembered that the Romans were far more precise than we used to be in their definition of cross-roads and employed no less than three terms, biuium when the road branched into two, triuium when the road forked into three, and quadriuium when the intersection of the ways gave four arms. The prophet Ezechiel tells us that Esarhaddon took his stand in biuio when he wished to divine: ""Stetit enim rex Babylonis in biuio, in capite duarum uiarum, diuinationem quaerens, commiscens sagittas: interrogauit idola, exta consuluit."" (xxi, 21.) ""For the king of Babylon stood in the highway, at the head of two ways, seeking divination, shuffling arrows: he enquired of the idols, and consulted entrails."" Triuia is the common name given to Diana, when as Hecate she was invoked at the crossways. Chariclides Comicus in Meineke's Comicorum Fragmenta, IV, p. 556, has τριοδῖτας, and invokes: Ἑκάτη τριοδῖτι, τρίμορφε, τριπρόσωπε. Varro, De Lingua Latina, VII, 16, writes ""Titanis Triuia, Diana est, ab eo dicta Triuia, quod in triuio ponitur fere in oppodis Graecis, uel quod luna dicitur esse, quae in caelo tribus uiis mouetur in altitudinem et latitudinem et longitudinem."" Macrobius, Saturnalia, I, ix, notes: ""Dianae uero ut Triuiae uiarum omnium iidem tribuunt potestatem."" In Wales it was said that witches slept by day under any boulder that might be at a cross-road, and when dusk had fallen they crept forth to steal little children and feast upon their flesh. The gallows was often erected at the cross-roads, and here the criminal hung in chains, and nourished by his rotting flesh the mandrake grew. Many are the superstitions which cluster around the mandrake or mandragora--""the semi-human"" as Columella (De re rustica, x, 19) calls it. It was the plant of fertility, the plant of magical virtue and occult power. In Germany it bears the name of the Little Gallows Man, and it was believed that when a murderer or p. 156 thief was hanged and his semen or urine fell to the ground there grew up the mandrake. In England the same superstition prevailed, and in his pasquil A Character of an Ugly Woman or a Hue and Cry after Beauty, 1678, the Duke of Buckingham wrote: ""Imprimis, as to her Descent, some Heralds derive her Pedigree from that of the Scotch Barnacles, and say, that she dropt from some teeming Gallows, or sprung up like Mandrakes from the S--- of some gibbitid Raggamuffian."" No one must dare uproot the mandrake for it moans and shrieks so fearfully that the digger will die with the yells ringing in his ears. A dog is taken and round his tail is tied a string, one end of which is attached to the plant. A man whose ears are fast stopped with wax and wool, tempts the dog away with some dainty. As the animal tugs at the cord the mandrake will be pulled from the ground, but the poor beast will fall dead at the horrid scream it gives. But there has been secured a talisman, nay, more a familiar. Even in the mythology of Ceylon the cross-roads play an ominous part. Thus in the Yakkun Nattanawa, which is defined by its translator, John Callaway, as ""a Cingalese poem descriptive of the Ceylon system of demonology,"" it is said of the Black She-Devil: ""Thou female Devil, who acceptest the offerings at the place where three ways meet, thou causest the people to be sick by looking upon them at the place where four ways join together."" The devil Maha-Sohon watches ""to drink the blood of the elephant in the place where the two and three roads meet together."" Maha-Sohon is the devil of the tombs, ""therefore go not in the roads by night: if you do so you must not expect to escape with your life."" Another devil, Oddy, stands where three ways meet, watching, and hot for mischief. Again the Devil of the Victim ""watches and looks upon the people, and causes them to be sick at the place where three roads meet, and where four ways meet."" Ralstan says that it is a common Russian belief that at cross-roads, or in the neighbourhood of cemeteries, an animated corpse often lurks watching for some unwary traveller whom it may be able to strangle and devour, eagerly quaffing the warm blood from his veins. In Cornwall to-day cross-roads are most carefully avoided after night-fall, but this may be because it is commonly accepted that at the cross-roads p. 157 witches from all the world over assemble for their sabbat. It seems more likely that these particular spots are avoided because of the vampires, for Henry Boguet tells us: ""Les Sorciers tienne~t leurs sabbats indiffereme~t en tons lieux."" Bernhard Ragner says that if you go to a cross-road between eleven o'clock and midnight on Christmas eve and listen, you will hear what most concerns you for the coming year. It may be pointed out that this is the one night throughout the year when strange wonders happen. It is then that the thorn that sprang at Glastonbury from the Sacred Crown which the holy old man, S. Joseph of Arimathea, brought with him from Palestine, when Avalon was still an island, bourgeons into fragrant blossoms. The Cornish miners seem to hear the sound of singing choirs that arise from submerged churches by the shore, and others said that bells, beneath the ground where villages had been, upon that eve yearly ring a glad peal. At midnight the oxen, the cattle, and all the beasts kneel and adore, as they adored in the stable-cave at Bethlehem. No evil thing hath power, and as the Officer in Hamlet tells us: Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated, The bird of dawning singeth all night long; And then, they say, no spirit can walk abroad; The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike, No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm, So hallow'd and so gracious is the time. In certain districts of East Prussia on Christmas Eve candles are kept burning all night in the houses and no window is shuttered. It is supposed that the spirits of the dead will return in friendly-wise and the opportunity is given to them to warm themselves, so that on future occasions when they haunt the villages with more malicious intent they may remember those who are kind to them Christmas after Christmas and spare those houses from molestation and injury. Not only are those who die excommunicate, that is to say solemnly and officially cursed by the Church, liable to become vampires, but more, those who die under any kind of such ban, especially if it be the malison of a parent, or if it be a man who has perjured himself in a grave matter and called down upon his own head damnation and all manner of evil should p. 158 what he asseverate be untrue. The belief in the fearful power of a curse, especially the curse of a father or a mother, which, whether rightfully or wrongfully adjured, works out its vengeance through the whole stock of kith and kin, involving in misfortunes and destruction, innocent and guilty alike, finds supreme illustration in the masterpieces of Greek tragedy. It is the mighty theme of the trilogy of the Oresteia, for from the very outset of the Agamemnon there is a brooding and oppressive sense of multitudinous crimes, of sins done long years ago which have swelled and accumulated their guilt like some black cloud of transgressions about to burst over the doomed race in a welter of tragedy and blood. The evil wrought by Thyestes, the crimes of his grandsire Tantalus, the atrocious banquet of Atreus, have yet to be expiated in misery, in anguish and affliction. When the weird Trojan woman approaches the threshold she scents the carnage of the shambles and horrors manifold, and as the pang of inspiration thrills her she shrieks aloud: ""The Furies are in this house; blood-surfeited, but not assuaged, they hold perpetual revel here. It is the crime of Atreus and of Thyestes which they hunt, and woe will follow woe."" τὴν γὰρ στέγην τήνδ᾽ οὔποτ᾽ ἐκλείπει χορος σύμφθογγος οὐκ εὔφωνος?<συπ?>·? οὐ γὰρ εῦ᾽ λέγει, καὶ μὴν πεπωκώς γ᾽, ὡς θραδσύνεσθαι πλέον, βρότειον αῖ?!μα κῶμος ἐν δόμοις μένει, δύσπεμπτος ἔξω, συγγόνων Ἐρινύων· Sophocles also no less fearfully shows us the tale of Oedipus and his children, the legend of the house of Laius, whose family was as equally famous among the Greeks as the stock of Atreus for its overwhelming disasters, the bitter fruit of an undying curse which destroyed the whole race. Laius, the son of Labdacus, had wrought a mighty evil. Lusting after the beauty of Chrysippus, the son of Pelops, with violence he raped the lad who belonged to another, and thus had sinned the sin of ὕβρις since he both betrayed another's love and used brute force in doing so. For this crime his whole progeny was involved in destruction. He married Jocasta, the sister of Creon of Thebes, and the oracle warned him that his son should kill him. When a boy was born to the royal pair they cruelly exposed their child, a helpless infant, to the p. 159 wild beasts on Mount Cithaeron, but the will of heaven is not frustrated by the impotence of man. Many years after as King Laius is riding privately in his chariot attended by only five servants they meet a young man upon the road. The king bids him make way, commanding him in rough and insolent terms. A quarrel arises. The stranger, a stalwart warrior, strikes down the master and certain of the servants, but one escapes and fled away for his life. Presently Oedipus solves the riddle of the monstrous Sphinx, when the Thebans, in gratitude, since their old monarch has been slain by robbers on the highway elect him to rule over them, giving him the lady Jocasta to wife. He governs the state in great prosperity, and four children are born to him, two sons, Polyneices and Eteocles; two daughters, Antigone and Ismene. It is the calm before the storm; a fearful plague afflicts the city, and when the divine Phoebus Apollo is consulted he answers that the murderer of Laius must be driven from the land. The old prophet, Teiresias, the mystic whose converse is in heaven, but who yet in his stern pride still retains much of humanity, is asked to rede the enigma. He answers with deep sighs and groans, seeking to be led home again, until goaded by the impatience and hot temper of the king he flashes forth the truth. But it is not immediately recognized, and Oedipus begins formally to inquire into the circumstances of the death of his predecessor. Detail is heaped upon detail and at last the horrible revelation forces itself upon his soul. Mad with terror, Jocasta hangs herself within her bed-chamber, and Oedipus tearing from her dress the buckles and clasps of gold strikes out his eyes that are unworthy to look upon the golden light of day. One moment a king, the next a beggar, red with parricide, polluted with the fires of incest, accursed of God and man, in the bitterness of utter dereliction he must go forth desolate and alone. He dare not even bid farewell to his sons and daughters for they are the children of doom, seed of that admixture too fearful to be named. In the next play, the Oedipus Coloneus, we find him many years afterwards, a mysterious figure set apart by heaven in awful loneliness. He is waiting in a place of peculiar sanctity, the reverent groves of the Semnai Theai, the holy goddesses of divine retribution, waiting for his silent passage to the shadowy world. And even here the evil ambitions of his sons would p. 160 fain disturb him at the end. But he is far removed from the strife and passion of this world, and when young Polyneices, fair, false and fickle, endeavours to enlist his father's sympathies the lad receives the awful answer: ""Dry were your eyes, hard as stone your heart, dumb your lips, when I went forth from Thebes friendless and alone. Here then is your reward: before the Walls of Thebes you shall perish, pierced by your brother's hand, and there your brother shall die slain by you."" This terrible imprecation is only too terribly fulfilled, and defying the laws of King Creon, who would have the curse-polluted ghosts of the brothers seek for rest in vain even in Hades, Antigone meets her doom. Nor does Creon, the respectable Creon, weak and spiteful, impotent, yet a tyrant, escape scathless. His malice is sharply punished, owing to his own folly and cruelty he loses both wife and son, for he has forgotten that great truth which S. Thomas enunciated, that ""reason is the first principle of all human works,"" and ""the secular power is subject to the spiritual even as the body is subject to the soul."" So owing to his impiety he is left without child to carry on his name, bereaved of all, broken and collapsed, piteously confessing himself--μάταιον ἄνδρα--feckless and foolish old man. It has seemed worth while thus very briefly and inadequately to review these two great themes of Greek tragedy, since in both instances they set forth in detail the terrible and relentless working of a curse, which it may be said has something of that divine vengeance that visits ""the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, unto the third and fourth generation."" And so something of this old Greek doctrine was very true, for who can foresee the end of the working of a curse? Even to-day there are places and there are properties in England which owing to deeds of blood and violence in their acquisition entail some dire misfortune upon all who seek to enjoy and possess them. Such a place is the ruined Abbey of Glastonbury, and of many another house--Tintern, Newstead, Cowdray, Waverley, Barlings, Croxton, Dureford--the tale is true. De male quaesita non gaudet tertius haeres, says the old adage, and it is well known that lands wrested from the Church will not descend in due course owing to a failure of heirs. Such a case has come under my own observation, and Aubrey in his Miscellanies cites Hinton Charterhouse p. 161 on Mendip and Butleigh, near Glastonbury as never having passed to the third generation. So did Cromwell's generals and adherents transmit a troubled inheritance to their descendants. Fairfax House, Putney, had its haunted chamber which was never used. It must be remembered that a solemn curse is not merely an expletive or an imprecatory exclamation, perhaps quite meaningless, but it is far more than this; it is significant and operative. The malediction is conceived as having a certain efficacious power, and it may be noted that this force if rightly launched does not seem to exhaust itself. No more terrible fate could be imagined than for a man to become a vampire, and this was the inevitable consequence if he were not cleared of a merited malison. The old proverb says: Curses are like young chicken And still come home to roost. This adage is terribly exemplified in the vampire who is supposed when he returns from his grave first to attack those who on earth have been his nearest and dearest. Of all curses the parental malediction is most dreaded, and curiously enough in Macedonia, Mr. Abbott tells us that a godfather is regarded with even greater respect than the actual parents and his ""malediction is dreaded even more than that of a Bishop."" At the present day in Greece many of the usual imprecations definitely refer to the fact that the person so cursed will become a vampire after death. Such imprecations as the following are in common use. ""May the earth not receive him,"" (Νὰ μήν τον δεχτῃ᾽ ἡ γῆς) ""May the ground not consume him"" (Νὰ μήν τον φάλῃ τὸ χῶμα) ""May the earth not digest thee"" (Ἡ γῆ νὰ μή δε χυνέψῃ): ""May the black earth spew thee up"" (Ἡ μαύρη γῆ νά σ᾽ ἀναξεράσῃ) ""Mayest thou remain incorrupt,"" (Να μείνῃς ἄλωμτος); ""May the earth not loose thee"" which is to say may the body not decompose (Νὰ μή σε λυώσῃ ἡ γἠ); ""May the ground reject thee"" (Νά σε βλάλῃ τὸ χῶμα); ""Mayest thou a become in the grave like rigid wood"" (Κουτοῦκι νὰ βλῃ᾽ς); ""May the ground reject him wholly"" (Τὸ χῶμα ᾽ξεράς᾽ τόνε), which last phrase is the most terrible of all since it is nothing other than an unspeakably impious parody of the prayer which is uttered by the mourners at every Greek funeral Ὁθεὸς ᾽χωρές᾽ τόνε, ""May God forgive him."" p. 162 Since even the curse uttered by a man in moments of anger and impatience may have such terrible effects, in Greece it is necessary that there should be some expedient which may dissipate and dispel the forces to which these words have given an impetus capable of producing the most serious and horrible results. Accordingly at a Greek death-bed there is carried out a certain ritual to attain this end. A vessel of water is brought to the bedside and he throws into it a handful of salt, and when this is dissolved the sick man sprinkles with the lymph all those who are present saying: ""As this salt dissolves so may my curses dissolve""; ὡς λυώνει τ᾽ἀλάτι, νὰ λυὡσουν ᾑ κατάραισ μου. This ceremony absolves all persons whom he may have cursed in his lifetime from the evil of a ban which after death he would no longer be able to revoke. The relations and friends then solemnly forgive the dying man for ought that he may have done against them and all present declare that they bear no grudge nor anger in their hearts. It is said that if the passage be a difficult one it is supposed that somebody whom the sick man has injured has not forgiven him. If it can be guessed who this may be, he is if possible, brought to the bed-side to declare his forgiveness of any injury he may have suffered. If, however, he be dead a portion of the cerements must be sought and burned to ashes in the bed-chamber of the dying person, who is fumigated with the smoke. These elaborate precautions and the extraordinary care which is taken, for it must often be a matter of very great difficulty either to secure the attendance of the living individual or to get hold of a portion of the necessary shroud, serve to show what immense importance the modern Greek attaches to the absolution from a curse, and what horror the thought of a vampire inspires. It is obvious that those who die unbaptized or apostate will be liable to become vampires after death, and throughout the south of Europe there still persist large numbers of ceremonies and superstitions connected with a christening whose object it is to secure the child a long, happy and healthy life. In England as in many other countries it is thought lucky to be born on one of the great church festivals, especially if it be a Sunday. In certain districts of Yorkshire even to-day it is commonly said that ""Sunday children are secure from p. 163 the malice of evil spirits."" Again a child born on a Saturday, although he may have ""to work hard for his living"" is considered to enjoy occult powers, to have the faculty of second sight, to be able to see ghosts and phantoms, and indeed to be so attuned to the supernatural that he can never be harmed even by the vampire. It is very probable that as Saturday is the seventh day of the week those born upon this day are considered as akin to a seventh son, who was so popularly believed to possess extraordinary powers of healing and the like. The old English rhyme is well known, and perhaps the following is one of the most usual forms: Monday's child is fair of face, Tuesday's child is full of grace, Wednesday's child is sour and grum, Thursday's child has welcome home, Friday's child is free in giving, Saturday's child works hard for his living. And the child that is born on Christmas Day Is great, and good, and fair, and gay. Although, as we have said, in England it is considered am omen of a happy life to be born upon some festival the exact opposite is the case in Slav countries. In Greece, particularly, nothing could be more disastrous, and of all seasons Christmas Day is the most unlucky. In many districts it is accounted a terrible thing for any child to be born at any time between Christmas and the Epiphany; such babies are called ἑορτοπιάσματα or ""feast-blasted,"" and after death they will assuredly become vampires. Even during life such a child is a Callicantzaros. The Callicantzaros is one of the most extraordinary and most horrible of all the creatures of popular superstition. Leone Allacci says that they only appear and have power during the week from Christmas to New Year's Day, but other authorities extend this time until Twelfth Night. During the rest of the year it is vaguely supposed that they sojourn in some mysterious Hades or under-world. Local traditions differ as to whether they are actually demons or whether they are human. Allacci, who certainly inclines to the latter view, says that children born in the octave of Christmas are liable to be seized with a terrible mania, that they rush to and fro with the most amazing speed, that their nails grow to a p. 164 terrible length like the talons of a bird of prey whilst their hands become as crooked claws. If they meet any person on the highway they seize him and put the question: ""Tow or lead?"" If he answer: ""Tow"" he may escape unharmed, but if he be inadvertent enough to reply: ""Lead,"" they grip him with terrible force, mangle him with their talons and often tear him to pieces, devouring him wholemeal. During the seventeenth century this belief so strongly prevailed that the most cruel precautions were taken in the case of children who might be suspected to be liable to become Callicantzari, since the soles of their feet were exposed to a fire until the nails were singed and so their claws clipped, and even to-day in parts of Greece these practices prevail in a highly modified form, for among the Ægean islanders it is said that the small Callicantzari are particularly prone to attack and devour their own brothers and sisters, which is another strong link with the tradition of the vampire who, as we have noted before, seeks the destruction of his own kin. It is difficult to convey any idea of the popular notions concerning the appearance of a Callicantzaros, as almost every local account differs from others in almost every particular. For the most part they are considered to be very gaunt and of enormous strength. On the other hand there are some who are dwarfed and stunted. The larger variety generally appear as ineffably hideous monsters with black distorted faces, eyes glaring red like fire, huge ears such as those of a donkey, great gaping mouths furnished with a slobbering scarlet tongue and sharp gleaming teeth, from which streams their fetid breath in horrid gusts. Again the pigmy Callicantzaros may appear in the shape of a child, but in this case it is usually deformed in some grotesque and painful manner. On the other hand they are sometimes harmless hobgoblins, full of mischief maybe, but objects of laughter rather than fear, though they may play many a naughty and tiresome trick not unlike the kobold and the leprechaun. A hundred tales are told of their pranks, but it is the more gruesome and the fiercer monsters with whom we are mainly concerned since it is from their ranks that the vampire is recruited, for most of them become vampires after death (a fact which seems to point to their human origin), and not infrequently they are supposed to indulge their vampirish p. 165 fancies during life. It will be noticed that in the various accounts of the Callicantzari there exist many contradictions, and we must bear in mind that such diversities are often due to the original conception of these creatures, whether they are regarded as demons or monsters who are suffered to plague the countryside for a certain number of days during the Christmas season, or whether they are regarded as human beings afflicted with a terrible curse, the victims of a most horrible possession, doomed never to rest not even in the grave. Near akin to the latter conception is the werewolf, who may be regarded as a man or woman, who either of his or her own will through black magic is able to change into the form of a wolf, or who in classical times was believed to be so changed owing to the vengeance of the gods; and in later days was believed to be so changed owing to the enchantment of a witch or some manner of diabolic possession. Moreover, a werewolf may be a person who without any actual metamorphosis is obsessed with all the savage passions and ferocity of a wolf, so that he will attack human beings in the same way as the actual wild animal. It may be asked, is it possible that a person should be so transformed? Henry Kramer and James Sprenger, the learned authors of the supremely authoritative Malleus Maleficarum, in discussing the question distinctly answer ""No, it is not possible."" They allow that by horrid charms and spells a certain subjective delusion or glamour may be caused, so that by the evil art of a sorcerer a man may appear to himself and to all others who gaze upon him to be a wolf, or indeed another kind of animal, but there cannot be any actual physical change of a man into an animal. This glamour or ocular illusion is sometimes known as ""sight-shifting,"" a convenient correlative to the accepted term ""shape-shifting"" which is conceived of as an objective fact. Moreover, in his De Ciuitate Dei, XVIII, 18, S. Augustine says: ""Nor can the devils create anything (whatever shows of theirs produce these doubts) but only cast a changed shape over that which God has made, altering only in show. Nor do I think the devil can form any soul or body into bestial or brutal members, and essences; but they have an unspeakable way of transporting man's phantasy in a bodily shape, unto other senses (this though it be not corporal, yet seems to carry itself in corporal p. 166 forms through all these things) while the bodies of the men thus affected lie in another place, being alive, but yet in an ecstasy far more deep than any sleep. Now this phantasy may appear unto other senses in a bodily shape, and a man may seem to himself to be such an one as he often thinks himself to be in his dream, and to bear burdens, which if they be true burdens indeed, the devils bear them, to delude men's eyes with the appearance of true burdens, and false shapes."" We must bear in mind that these explanations come from the highest authority, one of the greatest Doctors of the Church, and will, I think, very fairly cover most of the cases of the werewolf. In early days it was recognized that a werewolf might be a person who was afflicted with a horrible mania, and Marcellus Sidetes, who lived in the reigns of Hadrian and Antoninus Pius, circa A.D. 117-161, wrote Περὶ λυκανθρώπου, a long medical poem in Greek hexameter verse, consisting of forty-two books, of which only a couple of fragments remain. He says that Lycanthropy is a disease, a kind of insanity or mania when the patient was afflicted with hideous appetites, the ferocity, and other qualities of a wolf. He further tells us that men are attacked with this madness chiefly in the beginning of the year, and become most furious in February; retiring for the night to lone cemeteries and living precisely in the manner of ravening wolves. Under Lycanthropia, Burton notes as follows: ""Lycanthropia, which Avicenna calls Cucubuth, others Lupinam Insaniam, or Wolf-Madness, when men run howling about graves and fields in the night, and will not be persuaded but that they are wolves, or some such beasts. Aetius (Lib. 6, cap. 11) and Paulus (Lib. 3, cap. 16) call it a kind of melancholy; but I should rather refer it to madness, as most do. Some make a doubt of it whether there be any such disease. Donat ab Altomari (Cap. 9, Art med.) saith, that he saw two of them in his time: Wierus (De praestig. Daemonum, 1, 3, cap. 21) tells a story of such a one at Padua, 1541, that would not believe to the contrary, but that he was a wolf. He hath another instance of a Spaniard, who thought himself a bear; Forrestus (Obseruat. lib. 10, de morbis cerebri, cap. 15) confirms as much by many examples; one amongst the rest of which he was an eye-witness, at Alcmaer, in Holland, a poor p. 167 husbandman that still hunted about graves, and kept in churchyards, of a pale, black, ugly, and fearful look . . . this malady, saith Avicenna, troubleth men most in February, and is now-a-days frequent in Bohemia and Hungary, according to Heurnius (Cap. de Man.). Schernitzius will have it common in Livonia. They lie hid most part all day, and go abroad in the night, barking, howling, at graves and deserts; they have usually hollow eyes, scabbed legs and thighs, very dry and pale (Ulcerata crura, sitis ipsis adest immodica, pallidi, lingua sicca) saith Altomarus (Cap. 9, Art. Hydrophobia); he gives a reason there of all the symptoms, and sets down a brief cure of them."" It is remarkable that most of these features are found in the vampire, especially the unquenchable thirst, ""sitis immodica"" which is emphasized by the famous physician Antonio Donato Altomari, who was one of the most learned authorities of his day. It is also remarkable that the malady is reported as being very prevalent in Bohemia, Hungary, and Livonia, countries in which the vampire is most frequently found. There is in fact a very close connexion between the werewolf and the vampire, and the lycanthropist is liable to become a vampire when he dies. In parts of Greece, particularly in Elis, it is said that even those who eat the flesh of a sheep that has been killed by a wolf are apt to become vampires after their death, and this serves to show how powerful the pollution of the werewolf was supposed to be. In Norse saga, Ingiald, the son of King Aunund, was timid whilst a boy, but after eating the heart of a wolf he gained strength and courage and became the boldest of heroes. It might be thought that so far from inspiring a person with a thirst for blood the flesh of a sh"

122,The Clash,Lost in the Supermarket - Remastered,"Michael Pollan: The way we eat has changed more in the last 50 years than in the previous 10,000. But the image that’s used to sell the food, it is still the imagery of agrarian America. You go into the supermarket and you see pictures of farmers, the picket fence, the silo, the ’30s farmhouse and the green grass. It’s the spinning of this pastoral fantasy. The modern American supermarket has on average 47,000 products. There are no seasons in the American supermarket. Now there are tomatoes all year round, grown halfway around the world, picked when it was green, and ripened with ethylene gas. Although it looks like a tomato, it’s kind of a notional tomato. I mean, it’s the idea of a tomato. In the meat aisle, there are no bones anymore. Eric Schlosser: There is this deliberate veil, this curtain, that’s dropped between us and where our food is coming from. The industry doesn’t want you to know the truth about what you’re eating, because if you knew, you might not want to eat it. Pollan: If you follow the food chain back from those shrink-wrapped packages of meat, you find a very different reality. The reality is a factory. It’s not a farm. It’s a factory. That meat is being processed by huge multinational corporations that have very little to do with ranches and farmers. Schlosser: Now our food is coming from enormous assembly lines where the animals and the workers are being abused. And the food has become much more dangerous in ways that are being deliberately hidden from us. Troy Roush: You’ve got a small group of multinational corporations who control the entire food system. From seed to the supermarket, they’re gaining control of food. Schlosser: This isn’t just about what we’re eating. This is about what we’re allowed to say, what we’re allowed to know. It’s not just our health that’s at risk. Carole Morison: The companies don’t want farmers talking. They don’t want this story told. How about a nice chicken club sandwich made with fresh cooked chicken? You know, that’s a nice idea, but I think what I’d really like Schlosser’s voice: My favorite meal to this day remains a hamburger and french fries. I had no idea that a handful of companies had changed what we eat and how we make our food. I’ve been eating this food all my life without having any idea where it comes from, any idea how powerful this industry is. And it was the idea of this world deliberately hidden from us. I think that’s one of the reasons why I became an investigative reporter, was to take the veil– lift the veil away from important subjects that are being hidden. (film projector clicking) Schlosser: The whole industrial food system really began with fast food. In the 1930s, a new form of restaurant arose and it was called the drive-in. The McDonald brothers had a very successful drive-in, but they decided to cut costs and simplify. So they fired all their carhops, they got rid of most of the things on the menu and they created a revolutionary idea to how to run a restaurant. They basically brought the factory system to the back of the restaurant kitchen. They trained each worker to just do one thing again and again and again. By having workers who only had to do one thing, they could pay them a low wage and it was very easy to find someone to replace them. It was inexpensive food, it tasted good and this McDonald’s fast food restaurant was a huge huge success. That mentality of uniformity, conformity and cheapness applied widely and on a large scale has all kinds of unintended consequences. (mooing) When McDonald’s is the largest purchaser of ground beef in the United States and they want their hamburgers to taste, everywhere, exactly the same, they change how ground beef is produced. The McDonald’s corporation is the largest purchaser of potatoes and one of the largest purchasers of pork, chicken, tomatoes, lettuce, even apples. These big big fast food chains want big suppliers. And now there are essentially a handful of companies controlling our food system. In the 1970s, the top five beef-packers controlled only about 25% of the market. Today, the top four control more than 80% of the market. You see the same thing happening now in pork. Even if you don’t eat at a fast food restaurant, you’re now eating meat that’s being produced by this system. You look at the labels and you see Farmer this, Farmer that– it’s really just three or four companies that are controlling the meat. We’ve never had food companies this big and this powerful in our history. Tyson, for example, is the biggest meat-packing company in the history of the world. The industry changed the entire way that chicken are raised. Birds are now raised and slaughtered in half the time they were 50 years ago, but now they’re twice as big. People like to eat white meat, so they redesigned the chicken to have large breasts. – They not only changed the chicken, they changed the farmer. Today, chicken farmers no longer control their birds. (thudding) A company like Tyson owns the birds from the day they’re dropped off until the day that they’re slaughtered. (buzzes) Let me go to the top. – Man: This is the Chicken– The chicken industry has really set a model for the integration of production, processing and marketing of the products that other industries are now following because they see that we have achieved tremendous economies. In a way, we’re not producing chickens; we’re producing food. It’s all highly mechanized. So all the birds coming off those farms have to be almost exactly the same size. What the system of intensive production accomplishes is to produce a lot of food on a small amount of land at a very affordable price. Now somebody explain to me what’s wrong with that. (sniffs) Smells like money to me. (chuckles) 16 chicken houses sit here. And Chuck’s son has four over the top of this hill. The chicken industry came in here and it’s helped this whole community out. Here’s my chicken houses here. I have about 300,000 chickens. (barks) We have a contract with Tyson. They’ve been growing chickens for many many years. It’s all a science. They got it figured out. If you can grow a chicken in 49 days, why would you want one you gotta grow in three months? More money in your pocket. (chickens clucking) These chickens never see sunlight. They’re pretty much in the dark all the time. Man: So you think they just want to keep us out? I don’t know. If I knew, I’d tell you. It would be nice if y’all could see what we really do, but as far as y’all going in, we can’t let you do that. I understand why farmers don’t want to talk– because the company can do what it wants to do as far as pay goes since they control everything. But it’s just gotten to the point that it’s not right what’s going on and I’ve just made up my mind. I’m gonna say what I have to say. I understand why others don’t want to do it. And I’m just to a point that it doesn’t matter anymore. Something has to be said. (loud clucking) It is nasty in here. There’s dust flying everywhere. There’s feces everywhere. This isn’t farming. This is just mass production, like an assembly line in a factory. (fans whirring) When they grow from a chick and in seven weeks you’ve got a five-and-a-half- pound chicken, their bones and their internal organs can’t keep up with the rapid growth. A lot of these chickens here, they can take a few steps and then they plop down. It’s because they can’t keep up all the weight that they’re carrying. (wheezes) That’s normal. There’s antibiotics that’s put into the feed and of course that passes through the chicken. The bacteria builds up a resistance, so antibiotics aren’t working anymore. I have become allergic to all antibiotics and can’t take ‘em. (clucking) Morison: When it’s dark inside the houses, the chickens lay down. It’s less resistance when they’re being caught. Traditionally, it’s been African-American men. Now we’re seeing more and more Latino catchers– undocumented workers. From their point of view, they don’t have any rights and they’re just not gonna complain. The companies like these kind of workers. It doesn’t matter if the chickens get sick. All of the chickens will go to the plant for processing. The companies keep the farmers under their thumb because of the debt that the farmers have. To build one poultry house is anywhere from $280,000 to $300,000 per house. And once you make your initial investment, the companies constantly come back with demands of upgrades for new equipment, and the grower has no choice. They have to do it or you’re threatened with loss of a contract. This is how they keep the farmers under control. It’s how they keep them spending money, going to the bank and borrowing more money. The debt just keeps building. To have no say in your business, it’s degrading. It’s like being a slave to the company. Pollan: The idea that you would need to write a book telling people where their food came from is just a sign of how far removed we’ve become. It seems to me that we’re entitled to know about our food– “Who owns it? How are they making it? Can I have a look in the kitchen?” When I wanted to understand the industrial food system, what I set about doing was very simple. I wanted to trace the source of my food. When you go through the supermarket, what looks like this cornucopia of variety and choice is not. There is an illusion of diversity. There are only a few companies involved and there’re only a few crops involved. What really surprised me most as I followed that food back to its source, I kept ending up in the same place, and that was a cornfield in Iowa. So much of our industrial food turns out to be clever rearrangements of corn. Corn has conquered the world in a lot of ways. It is a remarkable plant. 100 years ago, a farmer in America could grow maybe 20 bushels of corn on an acre. Today, 200 bushels is no problem. That’s an astonishing achievement for which breeders deserve credit, for which fertilizer makers deserve credit, for which pesticide makers all deserve credit. Roush: In the United States today, 30% of our land base is being planted to corn. That’s largely driven by government policy, government policy that, in effect, allows us to produce corn below the cost of production. The truth of the matter is we’re paid to overproduce, and it was caused by these large multinational interests. The reason our government’s promoting corn– the Cargills, the ADMs, Tyson, Smithfield– they have an interest in purchasing corn below the cost of production. They use that interest and that extensive amount of money they have to lobby Congress to give us the kind of farm bills we now have. Pollan: A “farm bill,” which should really be called a “food bill,” codifies the rules of the entire food economy. Farm policy is always focused on these commodity crops because you can store them. We encourage farmers to grow as much corn as they can grow, to get big, to consolidate. We subsidize farmers by the bushel. Roush: We produced a lot of corn and they came up with uses for it. Larry Johnson: We are now engineering our foods. We know where to turn to for certain traits like mouth feel and flavor. And we bring all of these pieces together and engineer new foods that don’t stale in the refrigerator, don’t develop rancidity. Of course the biggest advance in recent years was high-fructose corn syrup. You know, I would venture to guess if you go and look on the supermarket shelf, I’ll bet you 90% of them would contain either a corn or soybean ingredient, and most of the time will contain both. Pollan: Corn is the great raw material. You get that big fat kernel of starch and you can break that down and reassemble it. You can make high-fructose corn syrup. You can make maltodextrin and diglycerides and xanthan gum and ascorbic acid. All those obscure ingredients on the processed food– it’s remarkable how many of them can be made from corn. Plus, you can feed it to animals. Roush: Corn is the main component in feed ingredients whether it’s chicken, hogs, cattle– you name it. Pollan: Increasingly, we’re feeding the corn to the fish whether we’re eating the tilapia or the farmed salmon. We’re teaching fish how to eat corn. The fact that we had so much cheap corn really allowed us to drive down the price of meat. I mean, the average American is eating over 200 lbs of meat per person per year. That wouldn’t be possible had we not fed them this diet of cheap grain. Since you’re selling corn at below the price of production, the feedlot operator can buy corn at a fraction of what it costs to grow, so that all the animals are sucked off of all the farms in the Midwest. There is a spiderweb of roads and train tracks all around the country moving corn from where it’s being grown to these CAFOs. Cows are not designed by evolution to eat corn. They’re designed by evolution to eat grass. And the only reason we feed them corn is because corn is really cheap and corn makes them fat quickly. (cow moos) Man: Where are you putting your hand? I’m actually inside the rumen– that first compartment of the stomach. And it’s– it’s not– it’s kind of hard to see. You can see the liquid part here. Man: Wow. There’s microorganisms– bacteria in the rumen, millions of ‘em. The animals evolved on consuming grass. There’s some research that indicates that a high-corn diet results in E. coli that are acid-resistant. And these would be the more harmful E. coli. Pollan: So you feed corn to cattle and E. coli, which is a very common bug, evolves, a certain mutation occurs and a strain called the “E. coli 0157:h7″ appears on the world stage. And it’s a product of the diet we’re feeding cattle on feedlots and it’s a product of feedlot life. The animals stand ankle deep in their manure all day long. So if one cow has it, the other cows will get it. When they get to the slaughterhouse, their hides are caked with manure. And if the slaughterhouse is slaughtering 400 animals an hour, how do you keep that manure from getting onto those carcasses? And that’s how the manure gets in the meat. And now this thing that wasn’t in the world is in the food system. A fast-food nightmare may be getting worse. A two-year-old child died today in Seattle. And the killer? Tainted meat from Jack In The Box hamburgers. A nationwide recall today for more than 140 tons of ground beef. Man: A half a million pounds of ground beef– of Con Agra ground beef. Schlosser: E. coli isn’t just in ground beef now– it’s been found in spinach, apple juice– and this is really because of the runoff from our factory farms. 90 confirmed cases of E. coli poisoning. Central to it all– raw, bagged spinach. E. coli outbreak with leafy greens in just the last decade. Schlosser: For years during the Bush administration, the chief of staff at the USDA was the former chief lobbyist to the beef industry in Washington; the head of the F.D.A. was the former executive vice president of the National Food Processors Association. These regulatory agencies are being controlled by the very companies that they’re supposed to be scrutinizing. Woman: ConAgra, which recently recalled peanut butter contaminated with salmonella, was aware of problems in its plant two years ago. Schlosser: There’s always been food poisoning. As more and more technology is being applied to the production of food, you would think it would be getting safer, not more contaminated. But the processing plants have gotten bigger and bigger. it’s just perfect for taking bad pathogens and spreading them far and wide. Woman: The recall of frozen hamburger now includes 22 million pounds. Enough meat to make a fast-food hamburger for every adult in America is being recalled. Schlosser: In the 1970s, there were literally thousands of slaughterhouses in the United States. Today we have 13 slaughterhouses that process the majority of beef that is sold in the United States. The hamburger of today, it has pieces of thousands of different cattle ground up in that one hamburger patty. The odds increase exponentially that one of those animals was carrying a dangerous pathogen. It’s remarkable how toothless our regulatory agencies are when you look closely at it, and that’s how the industry wants it. Patricia Buck: This is the USDA building up here. Did Josh say how much time he thought we’d get? Well, maybe as much as 15. Got to be on time for that meeting. – It starts a 4:00. So if I start going like that – or start shuffling papers, it’s time. – I know, it’s time. Thank you! Thank you. Kowalcyk: I’m a registered Republican. I’ve always been fairly conservative. I never thought I would be doing this and I certainly never thought I would be working so closely with my mom. Made a mistake– I think that’s the way we want to go. Kowalcyk: My mom and I, our relationship has taken on a whole new dimension. 2421? 2421. Here we are. – I’m Pat. to establish food standards, people just got complacent. We reduced funding for the FDA. We’ve relied increasingly on self-policing for all of these industries. And now we just have, really, lost our system. You’re really one of the champions on the hill for food safety and it’s a very important cause. It’s very personal to me and my family. Our food safety advocacy work started six years ago when my two-and- a-half-year-old son Kevin was stricken with E. coli 0157:h7 and went from being a perfectly healthy beautiful little boy– and I have a small picture with me today that was taken two weeks before he got sick. He went from that to being dead in 12 days. In July 2001, our family took a vacation. Had we known what was in store for us, we would have never gone home. We ended up eating three hamburgers before he got sick. We started to see blood in Kevin’s diarrhea, so we took him to the emergency room. And they said, “We’ve gotten the culture back from Kevin’s stool, and he has hemorrhagic E. coli.” They came in and informed us that Kevin’s kidneys were starting to fail. Kevin received his first dialysis treatment. He was not allowed to really drink water. We had these little sponges and we were allowed to dip that into a cup of water and then give him that. He bit the head off of one of them. You’ve never seen someone beg. He begged for water. It was all he could talk about. They wouldn’t let anybody bring any beverage into the room because– I mean, it was all he would talk about, was… water. (waves lapping) I don’t know if he knew what was happening to him… and I hope– I don’t know. To watch this beautiful child go from being perfectly healthy to dead in 12 days– it was just unbelievable that this could happen from eating food. What was kind of adding more insult to injury– it took us almost two or three years and hiring a private attorney to actually find out that we matched a meat recall. On August 1st, my son was already in the hospital. They did an E. coli test at the plant that was positive. They didn’t end up recalling that meat until August 27th, 16 days after he died. If we have some more hearings– which I’m sure we will– I’d love to have you come and testify. Kowalcyk: You never get over the death of your child. You find a new normal. – We’re going this way? Kowalcyk: We put faith in our government to protect us, and we’re not being protected at a most basic level. In 1998, the USDA implemented microbial testing for salmonella and E. coli 0157:h7. The idea was that if a plant repeatedly failed these tests, that the USDA would shut the plant down because they obviously had an ongoing contamination problem. The meat and poultry associations immediately took the USDA to court. The courts basically said the USDA didn’t have the authority to shut down the plants. What it meant was that you could have a pound of meat or poultry products that is a petri dish of salmonella and the USDA really can’t do anything about it. A new law was introduced in direct response and this law became known as Kevin’s Law. It seems like such a clear-cut, common sense type thing. Kowalcyk: We’ve been working for six years and it still hasn’t passed. I sense that there may be an opportunity– an enhanced opportunity– to get this signed into law this time. I think that from the standpoint of the consumer, a lot of people would support the idea of paying a little more if they could be guaranteed a higher standard of safety. that there are other players …that tend to worry about that, because it’s gonna be seen as an add-on to their costs. I think the advantage here is– Kowalcyk: Sometimes it does feel like industry was more protected than my son. That’s what motivated me to become an advocate. In the past year alone, there have been a multitude of food-borne illness outbreaks which have resulted in significant losses. Clearly our current approach to food oversight and protection is not meeting the needs of American families. It’s really hard for me to tell Kevin’s story. But the only way I’m going to be able to prevent it from happening to other people is to go out there and speak about it. Yeah. Six are elementary school students, one is a sibling, and there’s another one in another county in Kentucky, so… Kowalcyk: It will be seven years since my son died. All I wanted the company to do was say “We’re sorry. We produced this defective product that killed your child, and this is what we’re going to do to make sure it doesn’t happen again.” That’s all we wanted, and they couldn’t give us that. Pollan: The industrial food system is always looking for greater efficiency, but each new step in efficiency leads to problems. If you take feedlot cattle off of their corn diet, give them grass for five days, they will shed 80% of the E. coli in their gut. But of course that’s not what the industry does. The industry’s approach is– when it has a systematic problem like that– is not to go back and see what’s wrong with the system, it’s to come up some high-tech fixes that allow the system to survive. Man: The 5×5 product surge tank– low level. Low level. (man speaks over radio) Eldon Roth: This is our operations center. We control all of our plants from here. Where’s Chicago? Here’s Chicago, Georgia, Utah, Kansas, Nebraska, Texas, L.A., Ohio. We control all levels of the gearboxes, the speed of motors– we can change those all from here. We built something that– from a food-safety standpoint, we think we’re ahead of everybody. We think we can lessen the incidents of E. coli 0157:h7. (beeps) But I just started working with ammonia and ammonia hydroxide. Ammonia kills bacteria, so it became a processing tool. I’m really a mechanic. That’s really what I am. We design our own machinery. (whirring) Roth: This is our finished product. Man: Is your meat in most of the hamburgers in the country? Roth: 70%. In five years, we think we’ll be in 100%. We do have some competitors. I think we’re gonna beat them. - Roth: Again, it’s a marriage of science and technology. (man speaking over radio) I want dollar meal– …two chicken sandwich. – Man: Two small drinks, and give me a large Dr. Pepper. – $11.48. First window. Thank you. Maria Gonzalez: We didn’t even think about healthy eating because we used to think everything was healthy. Maria: Now that I know that the food is really unhealthy for us, I feel guilty giving it to my kids. But we don’t have time to cook because we leave at 6:00. We don’t get home until 9:00, 10:00 at night. When you have only a dollar to spend and you have two kids to feed, either you go to the market and try to find something that’s cheap or just go straight through a drive-thru and get two small hamburgers for them and “Okay, here. Eat them.” This is what’s gonna fill her up, not that one single item at the market. Look at the broccoli. It’s too expensive, man. First check to see how many are there for a pound. – Uh, we’re not getting it. You’d only get two or three. – Aww! Maria: We can find candy that’s cheaper. We can find chips that are cheaper. The sodas are really cheap. Sometimes you look at a vegetable and say “Okay, we can get two hamburgers over here for the same amount of price.” Pollan: Why is it that you can buy a double-cheeseburger at McDonald’s for 99¡é, and you can’t even get a head of broccoli for 99¡é? – We’ve skewed our food system to the bad calories and it’s not an accident. I mean, the reasons that those calories are cheaper is because those are the ones we’re heavily subsidizing. And this is directly tied to the kind of agriculture that we’re practicing and the kind of farm policies we have. All those snack-food calories are the ones that come from the commodity crops– from the wheat, from the corn and from the soybeans. By making those calories really cheap, that’s one of the reasons that the biggest predictor of obesity is income level. Over the course of human history, we were struggling to make sure we had enough food and enough calories for a sizable percentage of the human race. Now the problem is too many calories. The industry blames obesity on a crisis of personal responsibility. But when you’re engineering foods you are pressing our evolutionary buttons. The fact is we’re hardwired to go for three tastes– salt, fat and sugar. These things are very rare in nature Now sugar is available 24/7 in tremendous quantities. We’re eating hundreds of pounds of the stuff a year. This diet of high-fructose corn syrup and refined carbohydrates leads to these spikes of insulin and, gradually, a wearing down of the system by which our body metabolizes sugar. Maria: My husband’s diabetic. One of my main concerns is he could lose his sight. He does get into– sometimes he’s shaking, so I’m afraid that he’s gonna start not being able to drive, ’cause that’s what he does for a profession. We have to consider his medicine. What is it, $70? 50 pills costs me about $130. Maria: But he’s on two different types of pills. $100-and-something for one pill and then $100- and-something for another. That takes a lot of our income away. We’re really tight from either paying for his medicine to be healthy or buying vegetables to be healthy. So which one should we do? It’s hard to see my dad suffer with diabetes and stuff like that. And it’s really sad to see that my sister might have it. There’s something that’s going on in the way that we live our lives, where we play, where we buy our food and the types of food that we’re able to buy that is causing this epidemic. It’s not just our community. It’s not just Baldwin Park. It’s everywhere. How many of us know one person in our family with diabetes? How about two? Three? Keep your hand– It used to be that type 2 diabetes only affected adults. And now it’s affecting children at epidemic proportions. (kids laughing) (birds chirping) (chickens clucking) Joel Salatin: Everything we’ve done in modern industrial agriculture is to grow it faster, fatter, bigger, cheaper. Nobody’s thinking about E. coli, type 2 diabetes and the ecological health of the whole system. We’re outsourcing autonomous farmer decision making– we’re outsourcing that to corporate boardrooms in big cities 1,000 miles away where people make decisions and don’t live with the consequences of those decisions. (cows mooing) Everything is grass based. You know, they don’t eat corn, dead cows or chicken manure like they feed right here in the valley– or dead chickens. They actually eat grass, forage– you know, clover, grass, herbs. They’re herbivores. If they were eating corn, you’re gonna have to harvest that corn, transport that corn, then you’re gonna have to haul all that manure somewhere that comes out the back end. Here… it’s– there– there is the whole thing. I mean the cow is– she’s fertilizing. She’s mowing. We don’t have to spread any manure. We don’t have to harvest it– she’s harvesting it. It’s all real time– real solar dollars. The industrial food system gradually became so noisy, smelly, not a person-friendly place, that the people who operate those plants don’t want anybody to go there, because then people would see the ugly truth. When that occurred, then we lost all the integrity and all the accountability in the food system. If we put glass walls on all the megaprocessing facilities, we would have a different food system in this country. (knife zinging) Salatin: We have allowed ourselves to become so disconnected and ignorant – …as the food that we eat. What a difference this is to be out here in the fresh air, sunshine, birds singing in the trees, you know? But you see, according to the U.S.D.A, this is unsanitary because it’s open to the air. They tried to close us down. One of the biggest showdowns we had was when they tried to close us down because this was unsanitary. Can you imagine? So we had them cultured at a local microbiology lab. Ours averaged 133 C.F.U. and the ones from the store averaged 3600. Of course, those have been through 40 trillion baths. Ours haven’t seen any chlorine. A lot of people wonder “Is this real? I mean, can you really feed the world?” That whole thing is such a specious argument because, yes, we’re every bit as efficient, especially if you plug in all of the inefficiencies of the industrial system. I’ve had people come up at farmer’s markets and say “What? $3 a dozen for eggs?” And they’re drinking a 75¡é can of soda. Hey, pig. Hey, piggles. (snorting) Hey, pigs. I’m always struck by how successful we have been at hitting the bull’s-eye of the wrong target. I mean we have learned– for example, in cattle we have learned how to– how to plant, fertilize and harvest corn using global positioning satellite technology, and nobody sits back and asks “But should we be feeding cows corn?” We’ve become a culture of technicians. We’re all into– we’re all into the how of it and nobody’s stepping back and saying “But why?” (laughs) I mean, a culture that just views a pig as a pile of protoplasmic inanimate structure to be manipulated by whatever creative design that humans can foist on that critter will probably view individuals within its community and other cultures in the community of nations with the same type of disdain, disrespect and controlling-type mentality. (snorting) Eduardo Pe?a: The town where the plant is located is a small town called Tar Heel in the middle of a very economically-depressed area. Smithfield has mastered the art of picking and choosing a workforce that they can exploit, initially from the local workforce– the poor whites, the poor black. They went through that workforce very quickly. Now they have to bus their workers all the way from Dentsville, South Carolina, to Clinton, North Carolina. You have to draw a circle 100 miles in diameter, and that’s where all of your workers are coming from. (people chatting) Man: They have the same mentality towards workers as they do towards the hogs. (squealing) Man: You know, the hog, they don’t really have to worry about their comfort because they’re temporary. They’re gonna be killed. And they have the same viewpoint to the worker. You’re not worried about the longevity of the worker because, to them, everything has an end. Man: When you’ve got 2000 hogs an hour going through employees, because they’re handling these guts so much, they get infections in their fingernails and all. All their fingernails separate from their fingers. with blood, feces, urine. It’s easy to get hurt down there. Man: You’re doing that same movement for that same piece of the hog and it’s nonstop, you know. Basically you’re treated as a human machine. You get people that can’t afford to leave from out there, and Smithfield knows this. And that’s what they hold over you. Schlosser: 100 years ago when Upton Sinclair wrote The Jungle there was a beef trust that wielded enormous power. Immigrants from Eastern Europe were being abused in the absence of any kind of government regulation There were horrible disfiguring injuries and even deaths. Pollan: Things got better. They slowly got better. Schlosser: Teddy Roosevelt took on the beef trust. Labor unions slowly organized meatpacking workers and turned it into one of the best industrial jobs in the United States. By the 1950s to be a meatpacking worker was like being an auto worker who has a good wage, good benefits, pension. And then what happened? Well, the meat-packing companies got bigger in order to serve the needs of the fast-food industry, which was its biggest customer. Some of the meat-packing companies like IBP borrowed the same sort of labor practices from the fast food industry– cutting wages, making sure there were no unions, speeding up production, and having the worker do the same task again and again and again. And meat-packing is now one of the most dangerous jobs in the United States. The meat-packing industry also recruited a new set of immigrants– illegal immigrants and recent immigrants from Mexico. Many of the illegal immigrants coming to America were corn farmers in Mexico. NAFTA led to a flooding of the Mexican market with cheap American corn. It’s put more than a million and a half Mexican farmers out of work. They couldn’t compete with this cheap corn coming from America. (yelling) Pollan: So what happens to those million and a half Mexican farmers? Schlosser: Meat packers like IBP, National Beef and Monfort began actively recruiting in Mexico. Companies advertised on the radio and in newspapers. IBP set up a bus service in Mexico to bring workers into the United States. For years the government turned a blind eye to the recruitment of immigrants by the meat-packing industry. But now, when there’s an anti-immigrant movement, they’re cracking down all of a sudden, but they’re not cracking down on these companies. The government’s cracking down on the workers. (clears throat) Pe?a: Immigration agents are arresting Smithfield workers Pe?a: This is an agreement between Smithfield and Immigrations authorities. They get rid of 15 workers per day, but you don’t see any massive raids. That way it doesn’t affect the production line. – Sir, we are trying– She is asking us questions, not you. I don’t see anybody arresting no Smithfield managers. Nobody in the plant that had anything to do with the fact that those workers were hired is being arrested. What we see today is workers who were producing for this company and working hard– those are the people who get arrested. (man yelling in Spanish) Pe?a: We want to pay the cheapest price for our food. We don’t understand that that comes at a price. These workers, they’ve been here for 10, 15 years processing your bacon, your holiday ham and now they’re getting picked up like they’re criminals. (car starts) And these companies are making billions of dollars. Salatin: Is cheapness everything that there is? Who wants to buy the cheapest car? We’re willing to subsidize the food system to create the “mystique” of cheap food, when actually it’s very expensive food when you add up the environmental costs societal costs, health costs. The industrial food is not honest food. It’s not priced honestly. It’s not produced honestly. It’s not processed honestly. There’s nothing honest about that food. I can’t think of a better use for a Smithfield box. Man: It was about a five-hour drive maybe 300, 400 miles. So yeah. It’s worth it. Salatin: I have no desire to scale up or get bigger. My desire is to produce the best food in the world and heal. And if in doing so more people come to our corner and want stuff, then heaven help me figure out how to meet the need without compromising the integrity. That– that’s where I am. I have absolutely no desire to be at Wal-Mart. As soon as you grasp for that growth, you’re gonna view your customer differently, you’re gonna view your product differently, you’re gonna view your business differently. You’re gonna view everything that is the most important– you’re gonna view that differently. (snorting) (people chatting) This is our new organic line of popcorn. This is Vitasoy soy milk, the best soy milk in the entire world. This entire show when it first started was the size of this column right here. Man: Uh-huh. Several of us were sleeping in our booths. We couldn’t afford hotel rooms. Organic’s been growing over 20% annually. It’s one of the fastest-growing segments in the food industry. My God! Ah! We’re not gonna get rid of capitalism. Certainly we’re not gonna get rid of it in the time that we need to arrest global warming and reverse the toxification of our air, our food and our water. We need to be much more urgent. If we attempt to make perfect the enemy of the good and say we’re only going to buy food from the most-perfect system within 100 miles of us, we’re never gonna get there. As an environmentalist, it was pretty clear to me that business was the source of all the pollution, business was the source of basically all the things that were destroying this world. In college I came across this little institute called New Alchemy Institute, which was a group of renegade biologists. My hope is to give you– Hirshberg: We were preaching a kind of a new religion, trying to develop food and waste-treatment alternatives, but we were preaching to the convinced. We were depending on sources of support that were dried up and we weren’t reaching the audience that really needed these messages. I realized we need to not be David up against Goliath. We need to be Goliath. (clacking) Hirshberg: When we started out, we were a seven-cow farm. We wanted to prove that business could be part of the solution to the globe’s environmental problems. At the same time we had to prove that we could be highly profitable. Today in 2008, not only are in America, but we’re among the most profitable. See, this is the interesting thing. A little company like this is now Kraft, but you don’t have any idea that it’s Kraft. This is now Pepsi. That’s now Kellogg’s. – Man: Kashi is Kellogg’s? Yeah, this is one of those companies that started like us. – Well, it’s– Make them successful, basically. The jury is out. I have to put it that way. Hirshberg: These large companies don’t grow organically. They grow by acquisition. Coke, Pepsi, Kellogg’s, General Mills– all of them are running, not walking, into the organic food business. Hirshberg: For me, when a Wal-Mart enters the organic space, I’m thrilled. It’s absolutely one of the most exciting things. I have dreamed of the day when I could sit with corporate titans and have conversations about organics and sustainability. – Hi Amanda. I’m Rand. Okay, help me figure out where– – You’re with Wal-Mart. Yup. Do you know that we don’t go to Wal-Mart? – We’ve never been. – Isn’t that amazing? Yeah, we’ve never been. We just started boycotting a long time ago and we just kept riding on that. Hirshberg: Wal-Mart is terribly sensitive to their reputation. They’ve obviously been vilified, probably more than any retailer in our current economy. Actually, it’s a pretty easy decision to try to support things like organic, or whatever it might be, based on what the customer wants. We see that and react to it. So if it’s clear the customer wants it, it’s really easy to get behind it, to push forward and try to make that happen. Hirshberg: When I run into my old environmental friends, many are initially horrified by the kinds of company that I’m keeping these days. But when I then go on to explain what the impact of one purchase order from Wal-Mart is, in terms of not pounds but tons of pesticide, tons of herbicide, tons of chemical fertilizer, the discussion– we get away from the emotion and we get down to the facts. This is really key, though, what you guys are doing here. I have no illusions about this. I don’t believe that Wal-Mart has come here because they’ve suddenly had a moral enlightenment. It’s because of economics. I can debate with my radical friends all day long, but nobody can challenge the fact that a sale of another million dollars to Wal-Mart helps to save the world. Pollan: Back around the turn of the last century, the average farmer could feed six or eight people. Now the average American farmer can feed 126 people, okay? These are the most productive humans that have ever lived. The changes down on the farm have been momentous and radical but invisible to most of us, ’cause who knows a farmer anymore? But their way of life has been revolutionized. Roush: 10,000 years ago, farmers started saving their best seeds and planted again in the following year. That’s how seeds have been developed. That’s how corn was developed from a useless grass for the most part to the extremely productive plant it is today. Pollan: The idea that any corporation could own a food crop is a very new idea. It wasn’t until the 1980s that the Supreme Court said you could patent life. And that opened the floodgates– efforts to patent the most valuable parts of life, which is to say the crops on which we depend. Roush: Monsanto is a chemical company. They produced DDT, Agent Orange in Vietnam, and then they developed a product called “Roundup.” We started hearing rumblings about genetically-engineered soybeans that could resist the application of Roundup. When the Roundup was sprayed over top of it, it killed every weed out there except for this Roundup Ready soybean. Roush: I can remember when the first prohibition against seed saving came into being. Most farmers were just absolutely disgusted with the whole concept. It’s been interesting over the course of 11 years to watch us go from utter contempt for the notion that we can’t save our own seed to acceptance. Man: What happens if a farmer saves the seeds? (chuckles) Well, you know, really there’s only one company involved in this now and that’s Monsanto. Monsanto is… They’ve got a team of private investigators that kind of roam the country and they’ve got a little 1-800 hotline they take calls on. If they get a call and somebody alleges that somebody saved seed, they’ll send an investigator out to look into the matter. If you save your own seed, you’re gonna get a call from somebody from Monsanto. David Runyon: Two men drove in my driveway at 7:00, 7:30 at night, presented a black card to me and they never told me that they were from Monsanto. Man: They said that they had had a surveillance team, caught me cleaning beans. Moe Parr: I found it necessary to get up at 3:00 and 4:00 in the morning before the investigators are on the road following me. Runyon: They were– I’m gonna say maybe ex-military or ex-police. They were large and they were intimidating. Man: I don’t know whether they had their surveillance team or whether it was my neighbor that turned me in. I don’t know. Now as I turned to walk in the house, one of them said– I could hear in the back– He’s guilty. Runyon: It’s a real ingenious device designed back in the 1800s, and Monsanto’s gonna close all of them out. So how many seed cleaners are out there in the country do you think? In the state of Indiana, there may be six. Maybe. I’m not aware of– Have they all been put out of business? There’s nobody left. Runyon: When Monsanto soybeans first came on the market, I just never really switched over. I was getting pretty good yield with the conventional soybeans I’d been using, so I thought “Well, I’ll just stay where I’m at.” My neighbors all around me are all GMOs. If the pollen goes in, if the seed moves in, I am still held accountable. Pollan: When you genetically modify a crop, you own it. We’ve never had this in agriculture. Roush: Used to be that your land-grant universities, they developed what was called public seed. The vast majority of the plant breeding was actually done in these public institutions Pollan: Monsanto is very much like Microsoft. The same way Microsoft owns the intellectual property behind most computers in America, they set out to own the intellectual property behind most of the food in America. Roush: Public plant breeding is a thing of the past. There virtually are no public seeds anymore. Runyon: There’s only like four or five varieties that I can actually plant. Now I have some of the last soybeans coming out of the state of Illinois– When it comes to the point that I can’t buy any more certified seed, what do I do? What are my options? I acquired this list that was mailed to me. The black list here is Monsanto’s unauthorized growers list. Wow. Either farmers that have judgments against them, or businesses, or else it’s– or it’s farmers that have not submitted their paperwork, will not turn over their records. For my case, that’s why I’m on there– ’cause I would not turn over my records. Wow. I see two of the farmers that I work for on here. This list– now it comes down to the point where I cannot buy Monsanto products, okay? Right. So it’s coming down to What can I plant? Parr: Monsanto is suing me on the basis that I’m encouraging the farmer to break the patent law by cleaning their own seed. I haven’t been in a courtroom yet and my bill is already $25,000. People that were friends of mine now are reticent to even talk with me. We’ve been friends for 50 years, and now we can hardly be seen together. Right. I don’t think I’m really guilty, but it was cheaper to pay the fine than it was to try to fight it. …because if you think you’re right at something, but yet you admit you’re wrong. Roush: Monsanto falsely accused us of violating their patent and breach of contract. None of it was true. You go into a market, you find a dominant farmer and if you can ruin them, you scare the rest of them to following the line. My family spent $400,000 fighting the battle, pretrial. And we were told it would take another million to take the thing to trial. We settled out of court. The way the system appeared to work to me was Lady Justice had the scales and you piled cash on the scales and the one that piled the most cash on the scales, hired the most experts and was most willing to tell the biggest lies, that was the winner. That seems to be how our justice system functions now. It’s terrible. It’s terrible. How can a farmer defend himself against a multinational corporation like Monsanto? I talked to a young man just three days ago. They’d been to his farm, you know? And this poor kid, he’s just starting out. His fianc¨¦e was there. I talked to her and tried to give them the best advice I could. Unfortunately the best advice I could give them was “Try to get out of this thing with your skin intact. Don’t fight ‘em. You’ve got to roll over and give them what they want, ’cause you can’t defend yourself.” In the case of Monsanto, their control is so dominant. If you want to be in production agriculture, you’re gonna be in bed with Monsanto. They own the soybean. They are going to control that product from seed to the supermarket. They are, in effect, gaining control of food. Pollan: There has been this revolving door between Monsanto’s corporate offices and the various regulatory and judicial bodies that have made the key decisions. Roush: Justice Clarence Thomas was a Monsanto attorney. That wouldn’t be such a big deal if it weren’t for one court case that really decided this whole seed-saving issue. Justice Clarence Thomas wrote the majority opinion in a case that allowed these companies to prevent farmers from saving their own seed. Pollan: Monsanto had very close ties to the Bush administration… and the Clinton administration. This goes to why we haven’t had much political debate over this radical change to our food system. Pollan: For the last 25 years, our government has been dominated by the industries that it was meant to be regulating. Schlosser: The challenge is as soon as you have people with expertise in industry, they may turn out to be very good regulators. It’s really about what interests they decide to represent. You’re talking about power– centralized power and that power is being used against the people who are really producing the food like the farmers. It’s being used against the workers who work for these companies and it’s being used against consumers who are deliberately being kept in the dark about what they’re eating, where it comes from and what it’s doing to their bodies. (kids laughing) Woman: Good afternoon, Madame Chair and members. SB-63 is a consumer right-to-know measure. It simply requires that all foods that are cloned must be labeled as cloned foods. These cloned animals are a fundamentally new thing. But I find it incredible that the FDA not only wants to allow the sale of meat from cloned animals without further research, but also wants to allow the sale of this meat without any labeling. How many witnesses in opposition, please? Noelle Cremers with California Farm Bureau. And if I can point out– the reason that we are concerned with labeling is it creates unnecessary fear in a consumer’s mind. Until the industry has an opportunity to educate why we want to use this technology and the value of the technology, we don’t feel that consumers just having a warning label will help them. (chatting) Pollan: These companies fight tooth and nail against labeling. The fast food industry fought against giving you the calorie information. They fought against telling you if there’s trans fat in their food. The meat packing industry for years prevented country-of-origin labeling. They fought not to label genetically modified foods, and now 78% of the processed food in the supermarket has some genetically- modified ingredient. I think it’s one of the most important battles for consumers to fight– is the right to know what’s in their food and how it was grown. Not only do they not want you to know what’s in it, they have managed to make it against the law to criticize their products. Man: Can you tell me how you’ve changed how you eat? Yeah, we– you’ll probably have to talk to an attorney before you would put this in there. What? You can say this is– we’ve stopped– I know, but– I could have the meat and poultry industry coming after me and I really– Seriously? For saying– that it’s so– It depends on the context. You’re not saying Someone else don’t eat it. Yeah, I’m sorry, Robbie, but I get asked this all the time. Initially, my reaction was “I don’t care. Let them sue me. Let them try and sue the mother of a dead child and see.” It’s pretty amazing that you can’t say – how you and your family have changed– (stammers) are different. The food industry has different protections than other industries do. We have a lot of questions about this mad cow disease. Kowalcyk: If you recall the case where Oprah was sued by the meat industry for something she said on her show. It has just stopped me cold from eating another burger. – Good morning, y’all. it’s finally winding down? Well, I think I can say that, right? I can say that, yeah. I can see the end in sight. Schlosser: In Colorado it’s a felony if you’re convicted under a veggie libel law. So you could go to prison for criticizing the ground beef that’s being produced in the state of Colorado. There is an effort in several farm states to make it illegal to publish a photo of any industrial food operation, any feedlot operation. Schlosser: At the same time, they’ve also gotten bills passed that are called cheeseburger bills that make it very very difficult for you to sue them. These companies have legions of attorneys and they may sue even though they know they can’t win just to send a message. Man: We are on record for the deposition of Maurice Parr in the matter of Monsanto Company and Monsanto Technology versus Maurice Parr. your bank records in this case. Do you know that? Parr: I’ll tell you, what really scared me the most today was the fact that they have every check that I have written from every bank account that I’ve used in the last 10 years. Mr. Parr? Three. this Dell computer? Which ones are soybean seed cleaning customers? Parr: These people are not just customers, they’re personal friends. It’s extremely heart-wrenching for me to know that this list is in the possession of Monsanto. Harold Sinn? Beans only. Stephen Pennell: This is the first case in which a seed company is suing the person who does the cleaning of the seed. So if Monsanto’s claims are upheld in this case, that would not only put Moe out of business, but it would prohibit every grower in the country from doing what Moe does as a precedent in future cases. Have any of these customers specifically told you that they are not going to use Parr’s voice: This essentially puts me out of business. – Parr’s voice: I’m finished. Jerry Kaufman. Bill Zeering. Robert Duvall. Pollan: We’ve had a food system that’s been dedicated to the single virtue of efficiency, so we grow a very small number of crops, a very small number of varieties, a very small number of companies. And even though you achieve efficiencies, the system gets more and more precarious. You will have a breakdown eventually. And where the breakdown comes in the system we don’t always know. Roush: Modern production agriculture is highly dependent on large amounts of petroleum. Our farm, we’re going to use about 40,000 gallons of diesel fuel a year. Pollan: We eat a lot of oil without knowing it. To bring a steer to slaughter, it’s 75 gallons of oil. So what we’re seeing is that this highly-efficient machine does not have the resilience to deal with shocks such as the spike in oil prices. Food prices last month were 3.9% higher than they were a year ago. Take corn, another basic source of food, up to a 12-year high. Pollan: For a while, we could sell grains so cheaply anywhere in the world, farmers in other countries who aren’t being subsidized could not compete with us. So their capacity to grow food for themselves was compromised. Roush: The world’s running out of food and nobody’s talking about it. We have no reserves. Man: There have been protests around the world. The food crisis has already brought down one government. Pollan: A month doesn’t go by where there isn’t a story in the news that peels back the curtain on how that industrial food is made. (mooing pitifully) Man: Downer cows– too ill or lame to walk– being brutalized to get them to their feet for slaughter. Woman: Millions of gallons of concentrated hog manure flushing their contents downriver. Government’s food czar reported that there are no tools in place to track the origin of the latest salmonella outbreak. Pollan: Every time one of these stories comes out, America learns a little bit more– what’s going on in the kitchen where their food is being prepared. And every time they turn away in revulsion and start looking for alternatives. Hirshberg: The irony is that the average consumer does not feel very powerful. They think they are the recipients of whatever industry has put out there for them to consume. Trust me, it’s the exact opposite. When we run an item past the supermarket scanner, we’re voting for local or not, organic or not. At Wal-Mart, we made a decision about a year ago to go through a process of becoming rBST-free in our milk supply. We made that decision based on customer preference. Hirshberg: Individual consumers changed the biggest company on earth and in so doing, probably put the last nail in the coffin for synthetic growth hormone. Pollan: To eat well in this country costs more than to eat badly. It will take more money and some people simply don’t have it. And that’s one of the reasons that we need changes at the policy level, so that the carrots are a better deal than the chips. Schlosser: People think “These companies are so big and so powerful, how are we ever going to change things?” But look at the tobacco industry. It had huge control over public policy and that control was broken. The battle against tobacco is a perfect model of how an industry’s irresponsible behavior can be changed. (people talking) Salatin: Imagine what it would be if, as a national policy, we said we would be only successful if we had fewer people going to the hospital next year than last year. How about that for success? The idea then would be to have such nutritionally dense unadulterated food that people who ate it actually felt better, had more energy, and weren’t sick as much. Now see, that’s a noble goal. Kowalcyk: I can’t change the fact that Kevin’s dead. When you tell somebody you’ve lost a child, I really don’t like that look of pity that comes into their eyes, that they feel sorry for me. I can have a pity party all by myself very well, thank you. I don’t need it from other people. What I need them to do is listen and help me effect a change. Roush: You have to understand that we farmers, we’re gonna deliver to the marketplace what the marketplace demands. If you want to buy $2 milk, you’re gonna get a feedlot in the backyard. It’s that simple. People have got to start demanding good, wholesome food of us. And we’ll deliver. I promise you. We’re very ingenious people. We’ll deliver. That’s all I had to say. (“This Land is Your Land” playing) (audience cheering) When I rode that ribbon highway I saw above me The endless skyway I saw below me The golden valley Well, this land was made for you and me I roamed and rambled I followed my footsteps Through the sparkling sands of Her diamond deserts And all around me A voice was calling It said “This land was made for you and me” This land is your land This land is my land From California To the New York island From the redwood forests To the Gulf Stream waters Well, this land was made for you and me Now the sun came shining And I was strolling Through wheat fields waving And dust clouds rolling And a voice was sounding As the fog was lifting It said “This land was made for you and me” This land is your land This land is my land From California To the New York islands From the redwood forest To the Gulf Stream waters Oh, this land was made for you and me.

125,Stevie Wonder,I Just Called To Say I Love You,"No New Year's Day to celebrate No chocolate covered candy hearts to give away No first of Spring, no song to sing In fact here's just another ordinary day No April rain, no flowers bloom No wedding Saturday, within the month of June But what it is, is something true Made up of these three words that I must say to you  I just called to say I love you I just called to say how much I care I just called to say I love you And I mean it from the bottom of my heart  No summer's high No warm July No harvest moon to light one tender August night No autumn breeze No falling leaves Not even time for birds to fly to southern skies No Libra sun No Halloween No giving thanks to all the Christmas joy you bring But what it is, though old so new To fill your heart like no three words could ever do  I just called to say I love you I just called to say how much I care I just called to say I love you And I mean it from the bottom of my heart I just called to say I love you I just called to say how much I care I just called to say I love you And I mean it from the bottom of my heart I just called to say I love you I just called to say how much I care I just called to say I love you And I mean it from the bottom of my heart  Of my heart Of my heart"

131,Run-DMC,Christmas In Hollis,"It was December 24th on Hollis Ave after dark When I seen a man chilling with his dog in the park I approached him very slowly with my heart full of fear Looked at his dog, oh my God, an ill reindeer But then I was illin' because the man had a beard And a bag full of goodies, 12 o'clock had neared So I turned my head a second and the man was gone But he left his driver's wallet smack dead on the lawn I picked the wallet up but then I took a pause Took out the license and it cold said ""Santa Claus"" A million dollars in it, cold hundreds of G's Enough to buy a boat and matching car with ease But I'd never steal from Santa, cause that ain't right So I'm going home to mail it back to him that night But when I got home I bugged, cause under the tree Was a letter from Santa and the dough was for me  It's Christmas time in Hollis, Queens Mom's cooking chicken and collard greens Rice and stuffing, macaroni and cheese And Santa put gifts under Christmas trees Decorate the house with lights at night Snow's on the ground, snow white so bright In the fireplace is the yule log Beneath the mistletoe as we drink eggnog The rhymes you hear are the rhymes of Darryl's But each and every year we bust Christmas carols (Christmas melodies)  Rhymes so loud and proud you hear it It's Christmas time and we got the spirit Jack Frost chillin', the hawk is out And that's what Christmas is all about The time is now, the place is here And the whole wide world is filled with cheer  My name's D.M.C. with the mic in my hand And I'm chilling and coolin' just like a snowman So open your eyes, lend us an ear We want to say  Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!"
132,Jimi Hendrix,Castles Made of Sand,"Down the street you can hear her scream ""You're a disgrace"" As she slams the door in his drunken face And now he stands outside And all the neighbors start to gossip and drool He cries ""Oh, girl, you must be mad What happened to the sweet love you and me had?"" Against the door he leans and starts a scene And his tears fall and burn the garden green  And so castles made of sand fall in the sea eventually  A little Indian brave who before he was ten Played war games in the woods with his Indian friends And he built a dream that when he grew up He would be a fearless warrior Indian Chief Many moons passed, and more the dream grew strong until Tomorrow he would sing his first war song and fight his first battle But something went wrong, surprise attack killed him in his sleep that night  And so castles made of sand melts into the sea eventually  There was a young girl whose heart was a frown Because she was crippled for life And she couldn't speak a sound And she wished and prayed she could stop living So she decided to die She drew her wheelchair to the edge of the shore And to her legs she smiled you won't hurt me no more But then a sight she'd never seen made her jump and say Look a golden winged ship is passing my way And it really didn't have to stop, it just kept on going  And so castles made of sand slips into the sea, eventually"

155,The Clash,Should I Stay or Should I Go - Remastered,"As his cab turned by the end of the Pont Royal towards the Gare d'Orsay, M. Etienne Rambert looked at his watch and found, as he had anticipated, that he had a good quarter of an hour before the train that he intended to take was due to start. He called a porter, and gave him the heavy valise and the bundle of rugs that formed the whole of his hand baggage. ""Where is the office for forwarding luggage, my man?"" he enquired. The porter led him through the famous panelled hall of the Gare d'Orsay, and M. Etienne Rambert satisfied himself that his trunks had been properly registered for Verrières, the station at which he had to alight for the château of Beaulieu. Still attended by the porter, who had conceived a respectful admiration for him in consequence of the authoritative tone in which he demanded information from the various railway servants, and who scented a probable munificent tip, M. Etienne Rambert proceeded to the booking-office and took a first-class ticket. He spent a few minutes more at the book-stall where he selected an imposing collection of illustrated papers, and then, his final preparations completed, he turned once more to the porter. ""The Luchon train,"" he said; ""where is it?"" and as the man only made a vague gesture and growled something wholly indistinct, he added: ""Lead the way, and I will follow."" It was now just half-past eight, and the station showed all the animation inseparable from the departure of main-line trains. M. Etienne Rambert hurried onwards, and reaching the platform from which all the lines begin, was stayed by the porter who was laden with his baggage. ""You want the express, sir?"" ""No, the slow train, my man."" The porter showed some surprise, but made no remark. ""Do you like the front or the back of the train?"" ""The back by choice."" ""First-class, isn't it?"" ""Yes, first-class."" The porter, who had stopped a moment, picked up the heavy valise again. ""Then there isn't any choice. There are only two first-class carriages on the slow train, and they are both in the middle."" ""They are corridor carriages, I suppose?"" said Etienne Rambert. ""Yes, sir; there are hardly any others on the main-line trains, especially first-class."" In the ever-increasing crowd Etienne Rambert had some difficulty in following the porter. The Gare d'Orsay has little or none of the attractiveness of the other stations, which cannot fail to have a certain fascination for any imaginative person, who thinks of the mystery attaching to all those iron rails reaching out into the distance of countries unknown to him. It is less noisy than the others also, for between Austerlitz and Orsay the traction is entirely electric. And further, there is no clearly defined separation between the main and the suburban lines. On the right of the platform was the train which was to take Etienne Rambert beyond Brives to Verrières, the slow train to Luchon; and on the left of the same platform was another train for Juvisy and all the small stations in the suburbs of Paris. Very few people were making for the train to Luchon; but a large crowd was pressing into the suburban train. The porter who was piloting M. Etienne Rambert, set the baggage he was carrying down on the footboard of a first-class carriage. ""There is no one for the slow train yet, sir; if you like to get in first you can choose your own compartment."" M. Etienne Rambert acted on the suggestion, but he had hardly set foot in the corridor before the guard, also scenting a generous tip, came to offer his services. ""It really is the 8.50 you want, sir?"" was his first enquiry. ""You are sure you are not making a mistake?"" ""No,"" Etienne Rambert replied. ""Why?"" ""A great many first-class passengers do make a mistake,"" the man explained, ""and confuse the 8.50 with the 8.45 express."" As he spoke the guard took the baggage from the porter who had remained on the platform, and the porter, after being generously remunerated for his trouble by M. Rambert, hurried away to look for other travellers. ""The 8.45 is the express, isn't it?"" M. Rambert enquired. ""Yes,"" the guard answered; ""it runs right through without stopping at all the small stations as this train does. It goes in front of this one and gets to Luchon three hours earlier. There it is on the side there,"" and he pointed through the window in the door on the far side to another train on the next rails, in which a number of travellers were already taking their seats. ""If you prefer to go by that one, sir,"" he went on, ""there is still time for you to change; you are entitled to take your choice since you have a first-class ticket."" But Etienne Rambert, after a moment's consideration, declined the suggestion. ""No: I would rather go by the slow train. If I take the express I should have to get out at Brives, and then I should be twelve or thirteen miles from Saint-Jaury, which is my destination; whereas the slow train stops at Verrières, where, by the way, I have already telegraphed to say I shall arrive to-morrow morning."" He walked a little way along the corridor, assuring himself that the various compartments were still quite empty, and then turned to the guard. ""Look here, my man,"" he said, ""I am awfully tired, and I mean to get some sleep to-night; consequently I should like to be alone. Now where shall I be most quiet and undisturbed?"" The man understood. M. Etienne Rambert's enquiry about the place where he would be most quiet, was an implicit promise of a handsome tip if nobody did disturb him. ""If you like to settle yourself here, sir,"" the man answered, ""you can draw down the blinds at once, and I dare say I shall be able to find room for any other passengers somewhere else."" ""Good,"" said M. Rambert, moving towards the compartment indicated. ""I will smoke a cigar until the train starts, and immediately afterwards I will settle down to sleep. By the way, my man, since you seem so obliging, I wish you would undertake to call me to-morrow morning in time for me to get out at Verrières. I am desperately sleepy and I am quite capable of not waking up."" The guard touched his cap. ""You can be perfectly easy, sir, and sleep without the least anxiety. I won't fail."" ""Very well."" When his baggage had been stowed away, and his rugs spread out to make the seat more comfortable still, M. Etienne Rambert repeated his appeal, for he was an old traveller and knew that it does not do to rely too much upon the promises of chance attendants. ""I can rely upon you, can't I? I may sleep as sound as I like, and you will wake me at Verrières?"" And the more to assure himself that the guard would execute his orders he slipped a franc into his hand. When he was left alone, M. Rambert continued his preparations for the night. He carefully drew down the blinds over the door and over the windows of the compartment that gave on to the corridor, and also lowered the shade over the electric light, and then, in order to enjoy the last puffs at his cigar in peace, he opened the window over the other door and leant his elbows on it, watching the final preparations being made by the travellers by the express on the other line. The departure of a train is always a picturesque sight, and M. Rambert leant forward inquisitively to note how the passengers had installed themselves in the two compartments which he could see from his coign of vantage. There were not many people in the train. As a matter of fact the Brives and Luchon line is not much used at this time of year. If the number of passengers in the express were any criterion Etienne Rambert might reasonably expect that he would be the only one in the slow train. But there was not much time for observations and reflections of this kind. On the platform for the express, which he got a glimpse of through the compartments, people were hurrying up their farewells. The passengers had got into their carriages, and the friends who had come to see them off were standing alone upon the platform. There was the sound of safety locks being fastened by porters, and the noise of trollies being wheeled along bearing articles for sale. ""Pillows! Rugs! Sweets! Papers!"" Then came the whistle of the guard, the shriller scream from the electric engine, and then, slowly at first but steadily, more rapidly as the engine got up speed, the express moved along the platform and plunged into the tunnel on the way to Austerlitz. Meanwhile the guard of the slow train was doing wonders. Shamelessly resolved to assure perfect quiet to ""his"" passenger, he managed, without unduly compromising himself but yet without leaving any doubt about it in any mind, to insinuate discreetly that M. Rambert's carriage was reserved, so that that gentleman might count upon an entirely undisturbed night. A few minutes after the express had gone, the slow train drew out in its turn, and disappeared into the darkness of the underground tunnel. At the château of Beaulieu young Charles Rambert was just finishing dressing when a gentle tap sounded on the door of his room. ""It is a quarter to five, Charles. Get up at once!"" ""I am awake already, Thérèse,"" Charles Rambert answered with some pride. ""I shall be ready in two minutes."" ""What? up already?"" the girl exclaimed from the other side of the door. ""Marvelous! I congratulate you. I'm ready too; I will wait for you in the dining-room. Come down as soon as you are dressed."" ""All right!"" the young man answered. He wasted no time over his toilette, the more so because it was none too warm in his room, for at this early hour it was still quite dark; and then taking his light in one hand he opened his door carefully so as to make no noise, tip-toed along the landing, and went down the staircase to join Thérèse in the dining-room. The girl was an accomplished housekeeper already, and while waiting for the young fellow she had got a scratch meal together. ""Let us have breakfast quickly,"" she suggested; ""it isn't snowing this morning, and if you like we might walk to the station. We have plenty of time, and it will do us good to have a walk."" ""It will warm us up anyhow,"" Charles Rambert replied; he was only half-awake, but he sat beside Thérèse, and did justice to the preparations she had made. ""Do you know that it is very wonderful of you to get up so punctually?"" Mme. de Langrune's granddaughter remarked. ""How did you manage it? Last night you were afraid you would sleep on as usual."" ""It was not much trouble for me to wake up,"" Charles Rambert answered. ""I hardly closed an eye all night."" ""But I promised to come and knock at your door myself, so you might have slept without any anxiety."" ""That's so, but to tell you the truth, Thérèse, I was regularly upset and excited by the thought of papa arriving this morning."" They had both finished breakfast, and Thérèse got up. ""Shall we start?"" she asked. ""Yes."" Thérèse opened the hall door, and the two young people went down the flight of steps leading to the garden. The girl had thrown a big cloak over her shoulders, and she inhaled the pure morning air with keen delight. ""I love going out in the early morning,"" she declared. ""Well, I don't like it at all,"" Charles Rambert confessed with characteristic candour. ""Good Lord, how cold it is! And it is still pitch dark!"" ""Surely you are not going to be frightened?"" said Thérèse teasingly. Charles Rambert made an irritable movement of vexation and surprise. ""Frightened? What do you take me for, Thérèse? If I don't like going out in the early morning it's really only because it is cold."" She laughed at him while they were crossing the lawn towards the out-buildings, through which she meant to get out on to the high road. As they passed the stables they came across a groom who was leisurely getting an old brougham out of the coach-house. ""Don't hurry, Jean,"" Thérèse called out as she greeted him. ""We are going to walk to the station, and the only important thing is that you should be there to bring us back."" The man touched his cap and the two young people passed through the park gate and found themselves upon the high road. It was still very dark, with just a wan reflection in the distance of the sky vaguely outlining some cloud-shapes to the eastward to give some promise of the day. There was no sound to break the silence of the fields, and as they walked briskly along Charles and Thérèse could hear their footsteps ringing on the hard surface of the frozen ground. ""It must please you awfully to be going to meet your father,"" said Mme. de Langrune's granddaughter half questioningly. ""It is a long time since you have seen him, isn't it?"" ""Three years,"" Charles Rambert answered, ""and then just for a few minutes. He is coming home from America now, and before that he travelled in Spain for a long time."" ""He was travelling the whole time you were a child, wasn't he?"" ""Yes, always: either in Colombia, looking after his rubber plantations there, or in Spain, where he has a good deal of property too. When he was in Paris he used to come to the school and ask for me, and I saw him in the parlour—for a quarter of an hour."" ""And your mother?"" ""Oh, mamma was different. You know, Thérèse, I spent all  the childhood that I can remember at the school. I liked the masters and had good chums, and was very happy there, and if the truth must be told I looked forward with anything but pleasure to the holidays, when I had to go to my parents' house. I always felt a stranger with them; my real home was the school-room, where I had my desk and all my own interests. And then, you know, when one is little one doesn't understand things much; I didn't feel having hardly any family, very much."" ""But you loved your mother very much?"" Thérèse asked the question quite anxiously, and it was patent that she would have thought it dreadful if her companion had not had a real affection for his mother. ""Oh, yes, I loved her,"" Charles Rambert answered; ""but I hardly knew her either."" And as Thérèse showed her surprise he went on, telling her something of the secret of his lonely childhood. ""You see, Thérèse, now that I am a man I guess lots of things that I could not have had even a suspicion of then. My father and mother did not get on well together. They were what you call an ill-assorted couple. They were both very good, but their characters did not harmonise. When I was little I always saw mamma silent and sad, and papa active and on the go, and bright and talking at the top of his voice. I half believe he frightened mamma! And then my father was constantly away, whereas mamma hardly ever went out. When a servant took me to the house on Thursdays, I was taken up to say good morning to her, and I invariably found her lying on a sofa in her room, with the blinds down and almost dark. She just touched me with her lips and asked me one or two questions, and then I was taken away again because I tired her."" ""Was she ill, then?"" ""Mamma always has been ill. I suppose you know, Thérèse, that three months ago—stay, it was just when I had taken my degree and went to Germany—she was sent to an asylum? I believe my father had wanted her to agree to undergo careful treatment of the kind long before, but she would not."" Thérèse was silent for a few minutes. ""You have not been very happy,"" she said presently. ""Oh, it was only after I grew up that I felt unhappy. When I was a little chap I never thought of how sad it is to have no real father or mother. The last four or five years it has hurt me, but when he came to see me once at school, papa told me he would take me with him as soon as I had taken my degree and grown up. Last October, after my examination, he wrote and told me to be patient a little longer, and that he was hurrying on with the winding up of his business and coming back to France. That gave me a hope which has brightened these last few months, and will also make you understand why I am so pleased this morning at my fathers coming. It seems to me that a new life is going to begin."" Day was breaking now: a dirty December day, with the light filtering through heavy grey clouds that drifted along the ground, hid the horizon, clung to the low hills, and then suddenly dispersed in long wisps driven by a keen breeze, that got up in gusts, and drove clouds of dust along the hard frozen ground. ""I have not been very happy either,"" said Thérèse, ""for I lost my father when I was tiny: I don't even remember him; and mamma must be dead as well."" The ambiguous turning of the child's phrase caught Charles Rambert's interested attention. ""What does that mean, Thérèse? Don't you know if your mother is dead?"" ""Yes, oh yes; grandmamma says so. But whenever I ask for particulars grandmamma always changes the subject. I will echo what you said just now: when you are little you don't know anything and are not surprised at anything. For a long time I took no notice of her sudden reticence, but now I sometimes wonder if something is not being kept back from me—whether it is really true that mamma is no more in this world."" Talking like this Thérèse and Charles had walked at a good pace, and now they came to the few houses built around Verrières station. One by one, bedroom windows and doors were being opened; peasants were making their way to the sheds to lead their cattle to the pastures. ""We are very early,"" Thérèse remarked, pointing to the station clock in the distance. ""Your father's train is due at 6.55, and it is only 6.40 now; we still have a quarter of an hour to wait, and more, if the train is not punctual!"" They went into the little station and Charles Rambert, thankful for some shelter from the cold, stamped his feet, making a sudden uproar in the empty waiting-room. A porter appeared. ""Who the deuce is kicking up all this row?"" he began angrily, and then seeing Thérèse, broke off short. ""Ah, Mademoiselle Thérèse,"" he said with the familiar yet perfectly respectful cordiality that marks country folk, ""up already? Have you come to meet somebody, or are you going away?"" As he spoke, the porter turned a curious eye upon Charles Rambert, whose arrival had caused quite a sensation two days before in this little spot, where with but few exceptions none but people belonging to the neighbourhood ever came by train. ""No, I am not going away,"" Thérèse replied. ""I have accompanied M. Rambert, who has come to meet his father."" ""Ah-ha, to meet your papa, sir: is he coming from far?"" ""From Paris,"" Charles Rambert answered. ""Is the train signalled yet?"" The man drew out a watch like a turnip, and looked at the time. ""It won't be here for quite another twenty minutes. The work on the tunnel makes it necessary to be careful, and it's always late now. But you will hear when the bell rings: that will be when the train is coming over the level-crossing; it will run into the station three minutes after that. Well, Mademoiselle, I must get on with my work,"" and the man left them. Thérèse turned to Charles Rambert. ""Shall we go on to the platform? Then we shall see the train come in."" So they left the waiting-room and began to walk up and down the whole length of the platform. Thérèse watched the jerky movements of the hands of the clock, and smiled at her companion. ""Five minutes more, and your father will be here! Four minutes more! Ah! There it is!"" and she pointed to a slope in the distance where a slight trail of smoke rose white against the blue of the sky, now clear of cloud. ""Can't you see it? That is the steam from the engine coming out of the tunnel."" Ere she finished speaking the quivering whir of the bell echoed through the empty station. ""Ah!"" said Charles Rambert: ""at last!"" The two porters who, with the stationmaster, constituted the entire railway staff at Verrières, came bustling along the platform, and while the bell continued its monotonous whirring ring, pulled forward trucks in readiness for any possible luggage. Puffing portentously, the engine slackened speed, and the heavy train slowed down and finally stopped, bringing a noisy atmosphere of life into the station of Verrières that but a moment ago was so still. The first-class carriages had stopped immediately in front of Charles and Thérèse, and on the footboard Etienne Rambert stood, a tall, elderly man of distinguished appearance, proud bearing and energetic attitude, with extraordinarily keen eyes and an unusually high and intelligent forehead. Seeing Thérèse and Charles he seized his baggage and in a twinkling had sprung on to the platform. He dropped his valise, tossed his bundle of rugs on to a seat, and gripped Charles by the two shoulders. ""My boy!"" he exclaimed; ""my dear boy!"" Although he had hitherto shown so little affection for his child, it was obvious that the man was making a great effort to restrain his emotion, and was really moved when he now saw him again as a grown young man. Nor, on his part, did Charles Rambert remain unmoved. As if the sudden grip of this almost stranger, who yet was his father, had awakened a world of memories within him, he turned very pale and his voice faltered as he replied: ""Papa! Dear papa! I am so glad to see you!"" Thérèse had drawn tactfully aside. M. Rambert still held his son by the shoulders and stepped back a pace, the better to consider him. ""Why, you are a man! How you have altered, my boy! You are just what I hoped you would be: tall and strong! Ah, you are my son all right! And you are quite well, hey? Yet you look tired."" ""I did not sleep well,"" Charles explained with a smile. ""I was afraid I should not wake up."" Turning his head, M. Rambert saw Thérèse and held out his hand. ""How do you do, my little Thérèse?"" he exclaimed. ""You have altered too since I saw you last. I left a little chit of a child, and now I behold a grown-up young lady. Well! I must be off at once to pay my respects to my dear old friend, your grandmother. All well at the château, eh?"" Thérèse shook hands warmly with M. Rambert and thanked him prettily. ""Grandmamma is very well; she told me to tell you to excuse her if she did not come to meet you, but her doctor says she must not get up very early."" ""Of course your grandmamma is excused, my dear. Besides, I have to thank her for her kindness to Charles, and for the hospitality she is going to extend to me for a few days."" Meanwhile the train had gone on again, and now a porter came up to M. Rambert. ""Will you take your luggage with you, sir?"" Recalled to material things, Etienne Rambert contemplated his trunk which the porters had taken out of the luggage van. ""Good Lord!"" he began, but Thérèse interrupted him. ""Grandmamma said she would send for your heavy luggage during the morning, and that you could take your valise and any small parcels with us in the brougham."" ""What's that? Your grandmamma has taken the trouble to send her carriage?"" ""It's a long way to Beaulieu, you know,"" Thérèse replied. ""Ask Charles if it isn't. We came on foot and the walk would be too tiring for you after a whole night in the train."" The three had reached the station yard, and Thérèse stopped in surprise. ""Why, how's that?"" she exclaimed; ""the carriage is not here.  And yet Jean was beginning to get it ready when we left the château."" M. Etienne Rambert was resting one hand on his son's shoulder, and contemplating him with an affectionate, all-embracing survey every now and then. He smiled at Thérèse. ""He may have been delayed, dear. I tell you what we will do. Since your grandmamma is going to send for my luggage there is no need for me to take my valise; we can leave everything in the cloak-room and start for the château on foot; if my memory serves me right—and it is a very good memory—there is only one road, so we shall meet Jean and can get into the carriage on the way."" A few minutes later all three set out on the road to Beaulieu. M. Rambert walked between the two young people; he had gallantly offered his arm to Thérèse, who was not a little proud of the attention, which proved to her mind that she was now regarded as a grown-up young lady. On the other side of his father Charles made answer to the incessant questions put to him. M. Etienne Rambert enjoyed the walk in the quiet morning through the peaceful country-side. With a tender half-melancholy he recognised every turn in the road, every bit of scenery. ""Just fancy my coming back here at sixty years of age, with a great son of eighteen!"" he said with a laugh. ""And I remember as if it were yesterday the good times I have had at the château of Beaulieu. Mme. de Langrune and I will have plenty of memories to talk over. Gad! it must be quite forty years since I came this way, and yet I remember every bit of it. Say, Thérèse, isn't it the fact that we shall see the front of the château directly we have passed this little copse?"" ""Quite true,"" the girl answered with a laugh. ""You know the country very well, sir."" ""Yes,"" said Etienne Rambert; ""when one gets to my age, little Thérèse, one always does remember the happy days of one's youth; one remembers recent events much less distinctly. Most likely that means, my dear, that the human heart declines to grow old and refuses to preserve any but pictures of childhood."" For a few minutes M. Rambert remained silent, as if absorbed in somewhat melancholy reflections. But he soon recovered himself and shook off the tender sadness evoked in his mind by memories of the past. ""Why, the park enclosure has been altered,"" he exclaimed. ""Here is a wall which used not to be here: there was only a hedge."" Thérèse laughed. ""I never knew the hedge,"" she said. ""I have always seen the wall."" ""Must we go on to the main gate?"" M. Rambert asked, ""or has your grandmamma had another gate made?"" ""We are going in by the out-buildings,"" the girl answered; ""then we shall hear why Jean did not come to meet us."" She opened a little door half-hidden among the moss and ivy that clothed the wall surrounding the park, and making M. Rambert and Charles pass in before her, cried: ""But Jean has gone with the brougham, for the horses are not in the stable. How was it we did not meet him?"" Then she laughed. ""Poor Jean! He is so muddle-headed! I would not mind betting he went to meet us at Saint-Jaury, as he does every morning to bring me home from church."" The little company, Etienne Rambert, Thérèse and Charles, were now approaching the château. Passing beneath Mme. de Langrune's windows Thérèse called merrily up to them. ""Here we are, grandmamma!"" There was no reply. But at the window of an adjoining room appeared the figure of the steward, Dollon, making a gesture, as if asking for silence. Thérèse, in advance of her guests, had proceeded but a few yards when Mme. de Langrune's old servant rushed down the stone flight of steps in front of the château, towards M. Rambert. Dollon seemed distraught. Usually so respectful and so deferential in manner, he now seized M. Rambert by the arm, and imperiously waving Thérèse and Charles away, drew him aside. ""It is awful, sir,"" he exclaimed: ""horrible: a fearful thing has happened. We have just found Mme. la Marquise dead—murdered—in her room!"""

171,Talking Heads,Psycho Killer - 2005 Remaster,"ESSAYS THAT STILL NEED SOME LOVE!!!WHAT DO I DO ONCE I'VE RECEIVED FEEDBACK?1st PeriodPrompt: Discuss the greatest challenge you have faced or expect to face. I expect college to be a challenge. It may not be the most difficult challenge but it would be formidable. However, like any challenge I have faced it will be crushed. I’ll have to learn new concepts that are at least new to me. I might be perplexed by the way the system functions. However, I have a general idea of how college will operate. I just don’t have all the details. Will I like the professor? Will I not? I don’t know much about it. I will have to find out. I know the expectations will be different than any typical high school. Also, some high schools are more challenging than college. I’ll have to adapt to the new environment and change my study habits. College could also be easy. I don’t know. I still have many questions and I’ll assume that they will be answered. I guess it will be a new adventure. I still don’t really know. It’s just another step up. Even if I’m entering strange territory, I’m still confident; I’ll see what they throw at me. I know that we can request are classes to be spread out and if this is the case it will be easier because of the extra time per class. Whether it’s challenging or easy I’ll finish it. Prompt: Indicate a person who has had a significant influence on you, and describe that influence. “My mama always used to tell me: ‘If you can’t find somethin’ to live for, you best find somethin' to die for,” – Tupac Shakur. My greatest influence is Tupac Shakur. His words have always resonated with me. I’ve looked up to him since I was a young boy. I credit my father for introducing me to my greatest role model outside of my family. “A coward dies a thousand times, a soldier dies but once.” The best influence I gained from Mr. Shakur was to have a strong heart, will, and mind. With these things intact no way you can be deterred by anyone else. Letting someone break your down your heart to fight to can break your will. If you lose your will you can become weak minded and you need all three to survive. It’s like he always said, “If you can make it through the night, there’s a brighter day.” “I think I’m a natural-born leader. I know how to bow down to authority if it’s authority that I respect.” Another lesson I learned was to never give in to anyone and say what’s on your mind. The first amendment is the right to freedom of speech. Shakur believed that we all should exercise this right. He also believed that no badge of authority is just given respect but, it is earned just as anyone else will have to earn it. “Sh*t, I like to think that at every opportunity I’ve ever been threatened with resistance, it’s been met with resistance. And not only me but it goes down my family tree. You know what I’m saying, it’s in my veins to fight back.” It was in his blood to fight back that’s why he’ll never bow down to just any authority. “I see myself as a natural born hustler, a true hustler in every sense of the word. I took nothin’, I took the opportunities, I worked at the most menial and degrading job and built myself up so I could get it to where I owned it. I went from having somebody manage me to me hiring the person that works my management company. I changed everything I realized my destiny in a matter of five years you know what I’m saying I made myself a millionaire. I made millions for a lot of people now it’s time to make millions for myself; you know what I’m saying. I made millions for the record companies; I made millions for these movie companies, now I make millions for us” here he says he worked and earned every penny he has and gained his respect along with it. Hard work gives you everything you deserve. Prompt: What makes you, you? My life had many ups and downs, when I was a baby I was filled with smiles, laughed all the time, but that soon changed. I became an angry child or waterfalls of tears would run off may face during my child hood. Over time I learned to accept life, and then I learned to be happy. And I became a rosy cheek kid that tries to live an easy going life. when I was a kid with a face as red as a burring flame on the sun and sad, it all seem to be tied to how my life was going, my father was arrested and I could only see him for short times compared to when I spent entire days with him. I started living with people I barely knew but my mom new quite well, these people where called grandparents. And the things I always knew where changing for the rest of my life and it was a lot for a kid of four to take in and, caused pain for many years. Later in my life the streams if tears flowed so rapidly that soon I tried to make dams of rope at the line of the neck. My grandfather that I did not know as I child I learned to love like a second father had passed. So with the dames at a brake I knew it was time for a change. Whenever I would feel down I would search the ends of the earth to find the good in what is happening so that helped me learn how to except the negative thing that happen in my life. Once my grandfather passed who we depended on with most of our lives, poverty had soon come. We struggled to feed our self’s and we ended up having to move to a house a third of the size of what we once had. With that I learned to enjoy a loaf of bread instead of wanting a five course meal. With all the challenges that happened in my life I grew to a bigger, stronger, and better person. Through my whole life the warmth of a mother hug and the kiss from the heart a grandmother gives when times seem blue helped me adapt the love and care I try to share with others. In the past I was a heated person temper as strong as an ox. But there is only so much anger a person can handle in their life and over time I became to be where only the biggest things can makes my blood boil. After having a past of anger and people who said I was weird and a nut, I decided to let it roll off the cheek and became determined to still be that nut but be the best I can, I adapted determination from that point on. Through the roller coaster of my life I’ve lived hard painful times, with loss of love ones and massive changes. And I’ve had good times as well with love and happiness. People would think on how I was as a child I would be this miserable adult but they were wrong. I am living proof that challenges as hard as they may come can make a better person. I was a dark souled being that changed into a great, loving and, caring person. Who is determined and fallows my dreams. Prompt: Describe an important transition in your life. Since we were born we were told how important college is, we were told that we should already know what we want to do, and what college we want to attend. Even though we really don’t have any fore knowledge on what college really is, we are still expected to go. This, to me is the hardest transition anyone can face, making it the most important. Figuring out what you want to be when you grow up, we have been asked this question ever since the beginning of public school, kindergarten. Isn’t it ridiculous? Asking a five year what he/she wants to do when she/he is 20. Back then we all were oblivious to how fast life really moves; we didn’t know that outside of crayons and story time, there was a world waiting to be explored. Even though we had no idea where money comes from, or how a government works, we were still asked, “what do you want to be when you grow up?” Present day, that question triggers anxiety, and pent up confusion, because the answer isn’t as simple as “rock star” anymore, now you need a real answer. People say that high school is the best years of school you will ever have, because we can’t go back to it. Make your friends now, keep up with your grades, join school clubs, and get a part time job, pay your dues, graduate. It’s either now or never, go big or get a GED. Being pressured into going to college is probably the worst thing that can happen to anyone, it isn’t the 1960’s anymore, and we have other options. With tuition rising and employment decreasing, graduating college and getting a job is harder than ever, not to mention student loans. That’s why I feel this transition is so important, it opens the eyes of our generation, and things aren’t easy. We’ve all been handed a crystal clear picture of going to college being the only thing we can do. Growing up happens fast, and this still goes for the lucky ones that already have an idea of what they want to do after high school. For us, graduation will be the strangest feeling, no more school, no more summer break, no more standardized tests, we will all be floating around in our cap and gown trying to grasp the fact that we are done. I think that’s when you actually become an adult, because; isn’t that what adulthood is? Just a bunch of kids trying to figure everything out. That’s what makes this transition an important one, because it’s the hardest one we will face. Prompt: Discuss some issue of personal, local, or national concern and its importance to you Police Brutality is a national concern we need to put an end to. The people who are supposed to be protecting us are killing us! We the people must eliminate this racism and brutality in our police force. There is no time to waste action must be takin now. Brutality is not the way anyone should go. Our right as a citizen must be protected at all times. Nobody is above our rights or laws. Black minorities are the main people targeted by this threat. Most people would’ve thought we’ve move passed this racism. Equality is what needs to be seen in the eyes of not just officers but everyone. In my own experience I’ve seen white cops treat other races (Mainly Blacks) as if they were animals. We are no different than anyone else. Cops need to accept the fact that we are all the same on the inside. People are getting shot and killed for no reason. In the United States, major political and social movements have involved excessive force by police. Prompt:  “Describe a Person who has Influenced Your Life- Grandpa” As the sun began to peak through the fine curtains, I clenched my eyes and inhale the sweet odor of homemade biscuits and smoky sausages specially made by my pleasurable grand-mama. My limps felt detached and strained but my stomach was roaring another tune, soon became in debate with worn-out body. I eased to the edge of the bed leisurely took a quick glance at the clock. I didn’t bother reading the time though; I just know it was too early to hear that faint bussing outside. It was Saturday morning and the routine remained the same as always, I shimmied over to the one window facing the back yard already knowing what I was searching for, my grand-daddy. My grand-daddy wore a plaid red and black shirt, faded blue jean overalls and some dusty old work boot to mow the lawn in the early morning as, he rode his lawn mower from side to side and every few seconds he would briefly slowed down to spit his burnt sienna colored chewing tobacco, wipe his mouth with a bright white handkerchief and continue his journey. My grand-daddy is the chief of the Totten family. Born and raised in Yanceyville, North Carolina. He received only a 5th grade education and from there worked in the family business of farmers. He is the second youngest of four brothers and a sister. Out of all of his siblings except his sister he was the only one to ever go to school and come out with a work ethic of devotion. He puts his all in everything he does from head to toe this man has gave honor to the Totten’s name. Prompt:  Indicate a person who has had a significant influence on me, and describe that influence. The one person who has changed my life the most has to be both of my brother’s for good and bad. My brothers have had the most influence on me because I don’t want to be anything like at all. They both have been in and out of jail not for anything big like rape or murder but for dumb things like weed. But it’s not the fact that they went to jail that scary me and makes me not want to be anything like them but it the fact I seen everything that my mother has gone through because of brother’s and that’s what makes me want to be nothing like them fools. So yea that’s why I don’t want to be anything like my bothers they are good for nothing that just mess things up in my life and everyone else life there even messing up your life right now you don’t even know it. But for real if anyone how had impacted my life it would be them for the fact that I don’t want to be like them. But then you could look at it for another point of view and say they actually are good because of their massive mistake now I wound not make the same mistake they did. Topic: The Place That I Know Well Texas is the place that I know well. I have been to Texas lots of times in my life. Texas is a great place to be at. There are lots of things that you can do in Texas. It is a place that you ca have a great time and also relaxes. It is the place that I know bather than anything else in the world. Texas is where most of the things happen. You can feel the heat thrower your skin as you get closer to Texas. You can see lots of different things happening at the same time. Lots of cars passing by you as you go thrower the highway. There are lots of restaurant where you can eat at. You can small the different foods once you go inside the restaurant. Texas is as big as the United States. Every time I go to Texas I just can just relaxes all day. I feel happy every time I go there. It is the place that can make you feel safe at all times. It is where I can see lots of things that can make you feel happy. For example every time I go to the beach I have a great time there. Also when I go to see family members and have a great time with them. Prompt: If you offered the role of the villain or the hero in a movie, which role would you accept and why? Here come Jaeblast!! As the crowd would scream as I enter a nearby metropolis to save the day from evil. The role of a super hero is one role I would consider a choice of picking. Having superpower would be insane for me to decline that role because I would see myself as a protagonist and I believe I’m a good person by heart and soul. I believe in superhero’s since the day I could open my eyes. As the year passed my inspiration for the famous superhero Flash has grown over time. Flash has been Favorable to me due to the fact that he was a scientist in his own field in which I’m going to college to study/Major in. Whenever I see or watch Flash I think of myself in a scientific/energetic way of thinking. The flash was a scientist before he was even notice as a hero of the comic books. Prompt: “Advice you can give to students just starting their high school career” There are many advantages of going to high school and staying there for the full time that you should be there. At the same time there are many pitfalls and students can become confuse by the many decisions that we are forced to make. In most cases high school students want to make the best decisions about their future, and so it is important to learn of the various resources available to help make the right decisions as they will make an impact on life after high school. There are many advantages of going to high school. High school will provide you with many opportunities that will help to develop life-long skills such as learning, social and mental development. High school helped me to lay down foundations for growth and development so that I can become a productive and good member of the community. The knowledge presented in high school can help build the necessary foundations for a career you may be interested in. Students can learn various subjects such as business, health, sciences, trades, skills and technology, all of which can be apply to knowledge needed for careers in these fields or other fields. Experiences in high school can also provide you with opportunities for career development. In high school students can meet partners in business, science, technology and other fields and they can learn about these careers and professions from experts in the field. In some high schools, experts come in on career day and talk to the students about the various careers and professions. I always love when they come in. These events can also help students to decide what careers they want to get into when the leave high school. Another benefit is that going to high school helps students to build relationships with people such as teachers and other professionals in the fields already. When these professionals come in on career day, students can build professional relationships. You can get the experts as mentors and preceptors in the field. In high school you will also build relationships with each other and agree to go to college together. For me, I have very few friends that I can continue to be friendly with and hopefully go to college with. Some students would go to the same college and enter into the same or similar fields and in doing so long lasting friendly and work career relationships can be created. Another advantage in attending high school is that you get to learn about new methods and new technology in the workplace so that they can be more prepared when they leave school. There are many resources in high schools that with help benefit students. High school will prepare students to make better decisions about careers and about colleges where they can advance and go into careers, or further studies that they may want to do. Sometimes, I am not sure what job or profession I want to do after I leave school. The guidance counselors in high school will hopefully help to guide and direct my career paths. Resources such as libraries, career centers, and academies like science academy or technology academy can help me to learn about these specific fields. Schools have resources such as the internet that I can use to learn more about colleges and careers. There are also many resources such as books, brochures and pamphlets that will tell me about careers and colleges. While there are many advantages of going to high school and many resources to guide you, there are just as many pitfalls that can be misleading and dangerous. The large amounts of decisions that confront students can be overwhelming. Students may find pressure to make decisions and may rush into making decisions that they are not comfortable making. You might also rush and make decisions to please your parents. Sometimes I feel like I am being rushed by my mother to make a decision, but I have to remind her that I need to make my mind up. Another pitfall is that students could just be following their friends. Peer pressure could push students to make the wrong decisions for college, or peer pressure may force students to drop out of school. In high school you cannot cave into peer pressure. I had to make a personal decision for myself. High school students must be strong and make decisions best for themselves and their families. Another pitfall in high school is that students may become overwhelm by the many resources offered in school and that may result in the student not making the best and most timely decision. To help with the pitfall that may occur in high school, I need to remain positive and seek the resources that will help me to do well and stay in school. Students should go to school and learn the school work. You should also do your homework and ask for help when needed. Students should go to their guidance counselors, or their teachers for additional help when necessary. Sometimes I feel uncomfortable asking for help. You need learn important skills like asking for help, talking with the teachers, being responsible and respecting to the teachers. These simple skills can help you to stay in school, do assignments and home work so you can get good grades, a good grade point average and meet all graduation requirements. You should stay in school, so that you can graduate with good grades and then go on to further your education. Failure to remain in high school will result in poor grades, poor skills. If this happens, you will not get good grades, skills or knowledge that will help you to become a good person in the community. Therefore it is important to stay in school, use the resources, avoid the pitfalls and make the best decisions to stay in school. Prompt: Evaluate a significant experience or achievement that has special meaning to you. Going to a different elementary school s every year or every other year wasn’t always easy. Living with that transition as a kid wasn’t easy at all to make friends. Events like birthday parties and having people over were always difficult to set up because I didn’t really have a group of base friends that I grew up with. Plus my parents are the type that they have to meet the others kids’ parents for me to even come to a sleepover. Imagine being eight years old , walking into a new elementary school , not knowing a face in the school with butterflies in your stomach wondering how it’s all going to turnout . That was me at least four different times back in my elementary days. I would say the hardest task was to try and fit in. Every day was a new challenge to face because everyone knew each other and it was like I was the only crumbled cookie in a fresh new pack of opened Oreos. My teacher did try and make it better by doing all the introductions and trying to fit me in but I was still the odd ball in the pack. Plus as a kid was very timid, some would say anti-social, so that definitely didn’t help me. Honestly sometimes I even tried not to make friends because I knew I was going to end up moving. Prompt: Greatest challenge I have ever faced Moving away from the place I was raised in and lived the most of my life was very hard for me and my family. It was scary, but at the same time it’s exciting to explore the new beginning of our life. My mind was thinking that if I move away from all my loved one and friends, I won’t be able to see them again and I’m afraid I won’t be able to make any new friends in United States. After living in the Philippines for almost Prompt: “Discuss what makes you uniquely qualified for college” College is the next essential step; it is also the most talked about after you finish high school. The reason college is known for being so hard is because high school graduates don’t really know what they want to be. People their age rarely know what they want to be. Myself I have spent countless hours discovering what I would like to accomplish. Anyone can say they want to do something; it takes some drive and execution to pursue something you enjoy. There are many cases where I could have quit and people would have loved to see me fail. At the end of all that I just had to remember why I was doing it, and was it worth fighting for. To prove them wrong I work hard for whatever it took a months or years. I just had to stay determined and put all my essential qualities to use. High School is a rough time for some students. Students are figuring out what they want to become and finding out who they are. 50% – 70% of students change their majors at least once; most will change majors at least 3 times before they graduate. Not only knowing what you want to do is important, finding out whom you are necessary as well. Why is this important as a college student? Many students when they get to college don’t have the hard work and will power to continue. Students don’t know what works for them to be successful. I have spent many methods on how to plan and make myself successful. Someone once told me that they’re a difference between listening and learning. Anyone can listen but only some can learn. It is the same concept on having idea/dream, and someone who peruses their aspirations. I had teachers before that told me that “You would not go anywhere”. The only thing the teachers didn’t know was I did not take their “advice” into consideration. I kept myself from going the wrong way. The steps I took were I did all I could do, and if I was failing behind I made up the work. I continuing doing well and showed my teachers wrong. I could have quit and not cared but I was motivated because I had a goal to achieve. Hard work over weights anything I notice that hard work is like practice. Everyone knows the saying that “Practice makes perfect”. No matter how bad you are at something the amount of time I’ve practice takes an effect. I have put so much hard work into school. That I’m ready for a new challenge college is that next step. I have prepared my whole life to get this opportunity. With all the knowledge I have learn from preparing and my high school practice college I am ready for college. With all the things I have learned during my school years and my life lessons. I have learn a lot of new thing and will look forward to learning new things in college. Prompt: “Describe an important transition in your life” It was my first year of high school. I was excited and nervous at the same time I was excited because it was a new beginning for me. It what significant to me because it was a big change for me. I was going from middle school to high school. The alarm goes off it is now 5:00 a.m. it is time for me to get ready for school. I get off my bed and go brush my teeth then go into in to the shower. The water was freezing cold. When I got out the shower I rushed to my room and start getting ready. The time flew by so quickly. I got ready on time. I had few minutes before I had to go to the bus stop. I ate some cereal before leaving. Once, I left to bus stop I was walking with my sister. I arrived at the bus stop it was near the road where the cars were passing. The wind was blowing in my face because of the cars racing in the road. I could see the red lights flashing on the bus. The bus is getting near I start shaking and my hands are getting sweaty. I get on the bus and it feels as if I was walking into an oven it was hot. Furthermore, we are getting near the school and I get afraid. I don’t know what is it like to be in high school and it will be a new experience for me. We finally arrive at school. There are many buses there also. Suddenly, they yell out “unload” when they say that it means to open the door and let us out of the bus. Everyone starts rushing off the bus and I am patiently waiting for my turn. I get off the bus and start walking into the school. I walk in the school and there are lots of people. I am squeezing in between the crowd. I finally walk through everyone and it is time to look for my classes. I think to myself I don’t know where my classes are the good thing is that there were teachers in mostly each corner. I got to all my classes. I would look around to see if I had any friends in that class. Luckily, I had at least one friend in each class. I just wanted the day to be over as soon as possible. The thing that got me nervous was that my sister would always tell me, “high school is not easy.” The first day isn’t that bad because the only thing we do is get informed of what we will expect and our expectations and what we will learn during the year. Additionally, for me the transition from middle school to high school was a big change for me. The reason being is because I was already getting use to walking up later like around 7:00 a.m. Then, the following year having to wake up at 5:00 a.m. was a change. I had to get use to waking up at that time. It was hard because the first days I would wake up at the right time then, I would go back to sleep. I missed the bus a few times. I managed to get over that with time. The only thing I didn’t like is that I had seven classes. The other thing was that the classes were very apart from each other. For example, I had to walk from one building to another one in five minutes. Overall, I liked all my classes. For me high school was easy as long as I did my work. They start getting us ready for college. Prompt: “Discuss the greatest challenge you have face or expect to face” Challenge? What is a challenge? It’s something that you have to accomplish or something you have to face. Well everyone has challenges. Small ones, big ones but I never thought I would face the biggest one ever. That is my dad death. I had no idea it was going to happen that fast. So that’s the biggest challenge I have to face in my life. It was so unexpected I have to face. My life has change since that day. It began on June 30, 2014 that afternoon. I was hanging out with my friend Stefany. It was a great day. She left to go home. I went inside to my room. Then my mom got a call from my aunt. She told her that my dad had passed away. She came to my room. She told me and my sister that my dad has passed away. When I heard the bad news tears where rolling down my face. I had to call my older brother to tell him the news. He answers and when I told him. He was like your lying I’m like no I’m not. It was grandma all over. We went to see him in the hospital. It was the hardest thing I have to face to see. I almost fell to the ground and one of my aunts caught me. All the family was full of sadness and we couldn’t accept it. Later on that week it was his funeral. It was on Wednesday July 2, 2014. In the memorial service we were crying our tears out. When my family saw him it was horrible that we have to see him like that. During the service the ladies sung this song call “Yo Te Extranare” which it means I’ll miss you. That song is a dialogue of me and my dad talking. Every time listen to that song I always cry and be in pain, because it reminds me of him. Ever since the funeral nothing would make be happy. On that Saturday that week. We had this church event which took place in the park that my dad would always take me. That was also the park behind where my grandma and dad work. That day memories just came to me and tears came out too. So I walk around and cry my eyes out. When I was walking around. My mom was telling the people from church that my dad died that week. And she also told them that I was the most effected about it. Anyways ever since my dad passed away my life change a lot. All my friends ask me how you can live life still without your dad. I’m like I just don’t think about as much. Ever since then I haven’t been the same girl that I used to be. My religious beliefs change and so has my personalities. I’ve suffering for my dad death and for something else I can’t say. Every time I’m going somewhere. Something always reminds me of him and my memories come back. Oh also when I go to my grandpa house. I always think my dad is going to be there even though I should know he’s not there. I just can’t accept that he’s gone. My family and my friends say “It’s okay  your dad is now in peace and not suffering”. I’m like “No now I’m the one suffering “. I wanted him to see me graduate and see I made it. He saw my brother graduate and now he won’t see me. He would always tell me when he was here. “Ya me voy a morir” Which means I’m going to die. I hated that he would always say that. I would tell him “Pa no tengas eso” which means “Dad don’t say that”. So my life has complete became a suffering life. As can be seen life is so short. I want to live my life. Since my dad is no longer here I want him to know I’m doing everything so I would be successful. I want to become a writer, singer, and also an actress. He’s the only person that supported me on what I wanted to do with my life. So when I become one of those dreams of mine. I own it all to my dad. He made me what I am now and I want to accomplish everything I need to do. Now I’m not suffering as much for his death because I know he’s not suffering. And soon I would be with him. So this was the greatest challenge I have to face and still facing. Prompt: What are the three specific things you plan to do in Florida?

To be one of the best player on and off the court. My focus is coming to Florida with a good mindset. My study habits would be up to par while in the hot steaming room with no A/C. my sweat would fall off my forehead like bullet shells. As I try to write a perfect paper. As I am proof reading the paper for the professor to receive the fulfilling grade of success. As I’m done with my work for class I head to the gym with coach and the guys. As we practice on our plays for the games. While me and the team breathe hard with exhaustion. The coaches would let us take a break and drink a cold bottle of Gatorade. While we drink and take a break we discussed about getting the sunny beach college sate a championship. As we end practice I’ll go off campus to go work and find a way to stay productive. To stay on the right path and let others go on the wrong. As I drive on the smooth road with the bright glowing sun hits my face.

I would clean up the streets of Florida to help the community out with a place to claim for good and clean areas. Prompt: Evaluate a significant experience or achievement that has a special meaning to you. Many people have achieved different things in their lives. Some have achieved to get scholarships. Other where able to go pro in a sport they loved. There are a lot of achievements that people have been able to accomplish. A significant experience or achievement that has a special meaning to me is when I made it to Varsity Cross-Country. The first time that I joined Cross-Country I saw that there were many good runners. That inspired me to try to be the best runner for the team. I attended practice every day and gave it all I had. But one of my biggest obstacles that was stopping me from being the best was my knee pain. My knee pain was really bad and that was slowing me down big time. Therefore my sophomore season wasn’t the best; I wasn’t able to become the best runner for Berkmar. After I did therapy for my knee and I relaxed my joins I went back to running. But this time I did something different that I dint do the first time, I went to summer conditioning. Summer conditioning helped me out big time to become better and achieve my goal. I ran all summer long with the team; luckily I wasn’t having any knee pain. After summer conditioning finished our Cross-Country season started again. I was determined to achieve my goal that year. Two weeks into the season and we had our first race of the year. After getting an 18:29 for a 3.1 mile race I knew I was on track to achieving my goal. I kept working hard to get even better and by the time you know it I was top varsity for Berkmar High School. I finished that year with my best time of 17:52. This year I am setting a new goal. That goal is to beat my personal record that I set last year. I’m going to put even more work in and I’m going to try more hard to achieve that goal. I know that I focus on my goal I’ll be able to reach it. The goal I am setting for this season it to run a 17:00 flat or less if possible. My main goal that I had was been to become a varsity runner. That goal has been accomplished, now I have to set new goals so I can keep making accomplishments in life. A new goal I have is to beat my personal record of 17:52 and hopefully get a Cross-Country scholarship. Overall the achievement that has a special meaning to me is the fact I was able to become varsity for Berkmar High School. Prompt: ”Evaluate a significant experience or achievement that that has special meaning to you.” One of the greatest achievements is to graduate and fulfill all the dreams and goals that I have set for myself. This world is full of people that had set goals, and dreams but never did anything to make them come true. I don’t want to be one more of those people that don’t do anything to not make them; I will do whatever it takes just to make it happen. I want these not only for myself but I part for my family. They have been there sense day one and I appreciate all their support. Why do I say that I don’t only want it for me but for my family? Because, my family has been there for me without thinking about it twice, they have had my back, no matter what they will always be there. They push me to do my very best all the time, and tell me every time that I should never stop fighting for what I want, if I want it to go for it. Even when the get too pushy and very stressful I know they don’t do it to frustrate me they do it because they care and want me to do good in life and even though I feel like they pressure me sometimes I know it’s because they care. By me graduating and entering college, would be the best achievement ever not only because I prove myself that I could do but because I would be making my mom prude, and for all of those people that didn’t have faith in me or never believe that I could have done it. I want to give the best I have and be successful. My mother is one thing that push me the most to do good, and I want to make her proud and show her that I can do it, and by that I will be giving her back a little out of all that she has gave me. That is the main achievement that I have in mind, the one that is going to take me far in life the one that I’m going to be proud to say that I made it and that I did it all by myself, with hard effort but I made it. Everybody is born with a purpose in life, I know mine. Now the only thing I have left is to get to it and do anything it takes to get it done. Think of a place you know well. Describe the place and include feelings about it. Have you ever wanted to go back in time, and visit that one place that brings a smile to your face? Meanwhile that exact place is so far from your reach, and on the other hand it’s extremely close to your heart. When I think of that place I only imagine Guatemala. There are three areas in Guatemala that I enjoy tremendously which are in some ways very different and similar at the same time. Venecia, Guatemala is one of these areas that I adore to stay at. Primarily I’m fondled at the fact that my mom was born around this district. Also her parents and my grandparents still live there to this day. Every time I go spend time over there I fancy walking through the high stalks of green corn and getting lost for hours with my little cousin Yasmin. Another thing I’m delighted by is the morning breeze hugging my skin so tight that goose bumps appear throughout by body. Evenings were even better; my grandmother would stir up a cup of coco for my sister and me and included bread on the side to make the experience even more outstanding. I won’t ever forget the time when my sister and I put ten baby chicks in a circle and surrounded them with something. After a few seconds we would lift that something and the chicks would run in every direction. The place was to collect each one of the chicks until we got ten again. This specific moment made me feel butterflies and fireworks inside my tummy. Every single time I go to visit the moment is extremely pleasant and unforgettable. My heart speeds up every time I am able to go to Guatemala. Another place I’m exited in Guatemala to spend time at is chela. Chela is located near the city. It’s three hours from the city but a hot sweaty three hours in the car. My mom’s little brother Rudy lives there in a two story home. I love going there because I get to share moments with my baby cousin. I remember once my brother, sister and I went to a water park like thirty minutes away. My eyes almost popped out of my head once I saw the price of each ticket. Each one of us had to pay one hundred quetzals, which is the name of the currency in Guatemala. In U.S currency it would vary from fourteen to fifteen dollars. The money didn’t really bother me at the end of the day. I saw huge slide with people shouting and screaming. The one ride that is unforgettable to me was the one where all three of us got into one float and were pushed in a giant swirling slide and we at got wet and at the end of the slide was a pool where we fell into. My heart was racing the entire time we were there. After the water park we headed back to my uncle’s house where we ate a fish that was whole and looking at me. This started to make my stomach to move from the smile on my face. After a few weeks my other grandparents, my dad’s parents came to pick my sister and I up to go stay with them until the day we had to come back to Georgia. My father’s parents live the closest to the city. Its one and a half hours away. The interesting part of Chimaltenango, Guatemala is that it’s always mid-warm there and I love the sun beating against my skin. I adore helping out in my grandfather’s store where he basically sells everybody’s needs. The benefit of being his granddaughter was that I basically owned his store as well. What I mean by that was I could take anything and pig out on whatever I craved. Luckily that wasn’t the only thing to do at their house. At times I would help my grandma water all her crops such as bananas,plantans,mangos Prompt: A person that who has had a significant influence on you, and describe that influence. They say ‘Never Judge A book by Its Cover “, but why does everyone still judge me because of the carrier I want to take or the job I would love to have. People are always telling me what to do and what is best for me, but I don’t want what happen to my cousin happening to me. I really want to be a doctor’s assistants and I will be because I have the skills for it. My cousin always wanted to travel the world, but her parents never let her do what she wanted to do with her life, since they were the ones who were paying her college and her books. People and family members would always judge her because they thought she would never get to that level since most of us were poor. She knew that one day she was going to be traveling to many countries, and luckily the United States government sent a letter to her school asking for a voluntary helper to go to out the country and help others. When everyone doubt it her, she always believed in herself. From the time I was able to realize that the U.C (University Of California) was the best for me and my future, I decide to do my research on it. 2nd PeriodPrompt: Indicate a person who has had a significant influence on you, and describe that influence. Through out the good and the bad and the ugly she has been there. When i was sick feeling like i was on my death bed,she was there. When i just plainly need someone to talk to or a friend she was always there. That person is my mom. My mother has made the greatest influence on my life out of everyone i have know to this day. Throughout all the struggle she, me and my family as a whole she has been there and she was the one to keep it all together and kept a smile on her face even when she felt like she could just leave ,she stayed and fought through it all. She was my mother. My moms name is Yezzet Lewis Thomas. She is a Licensed Practical Nurses or LPN and she is working on her RN degree (Registered Nurses). Born in France moved to the United States when she was 2 and has 9 brothers and sisters her family was a military family with her dad serving in the military. One reason i chose her to be my biggest influence on me is the fact she was always there for me. when i was younger from Elementary to Middle school I had a really hard time making friends and had lots of issues with me being bullied and my constant stutter did not make it any better from my point of view, It just gave others more ammo to fire at me day after day and i struggled with life. But i always knew i could come home and wait to 8 o'clock the time she gets off of work and just talk to her about it like she was my best friend. She was always on my side and when i needed stuff done school wise she would stay up late to help me even if she had to go back to work at 6 in the AM. Describe an important transition in your life. My name was not called to participate in the 2014-2015 Peachtree Ridge, three day soccer tryouts. The coach said, “we do not have your physical on file”, but yet I turned mine in to the lady soccer adviser and she said she will put it in the day I gave it to her a week before. The JV coach told me to ask Coach Sutton, the Varsity coach, to see if I can still tryout. When I walked over to him, and informed him on the situation, he looked me up and down looking at how I was dressed, I am new to the soccer world so I had some; black vans, shorts and two hoodies on, that day was the day it started to snow, and he said, “well if it is not on file then I will not let you tryout.” I was outside for hours just practicing in the cold after school, from 2:10 to 5:00. Being told in front of the whole soccer team and new comers, that you can’t tryout, is embarrassing, and it really hurts you. I knew I turned in my Physical Form but they “did not have it”. Later on that day of the tryouts, my mom emailed Coach Sutton, and informed him that I did turn it in to the Soccer Lady. So the Coach replies saying that I am able to come to the second day tryout and I will be evaluated closely during the tryout. I told my mom no, I will not go to the tryout because I will feel the pressure and know they are watching me closely, I also did not want not meet their standers and still not make the team. Plus, I did not have much experience to the game of soccer, so I thought it would be best of me to not go and work on my skills for the game till next year. So from the day after the second tryout, I was practicing soccer left and right, outside working on ball control, my touches, juggling, and at parks working on my shooting. I have improved a lot from the tryouts. I am glad that I decided to go off and improve my skills, I am more confident to tryout now, but still will be nervous and feel the pressure. I moved schools my last year of high school, to Berkmar High school and I am trying out this year, I will be attending Conditioning, did not do it at Peachtree Ridge, but I will now. Seniors have to try out for Varsity and juniors too and then sophomores and freshman have to try out for JV. So I will be preparing myself for Varsity tryouts, and the Varsity Coach, is also my Psychology teacher. He knows I am trying out for soccer and has been informing me the updates on soccer. I got my physical done and now I am just getting myself ready for conditioning. My future career goals with soccer, is to make it to an MLS (Major League Soccer) Team. MLS is only teams held in The United States, so American Teams. I have a few teams in mind, for example; Orlando FC, New York City, New York City Red Bulls and LA Galaxy. In 2017, Georgia will have their own MLS team, I would like to try them out first. So ever since that day after tryouts, I have opened my mind to soccer, learned more about soccer and would to take it up a notch in my life. I may not be much good but all I can do from then and to the future is practice. Prompt: Discuss What Makes You Uniquely qualified for This Position Not everyone is qualified for every job or career. I know I have the potential to be a police officer. Wearing the blue is not the easiest or most popular position right now but I am motivated to do it. Having the dream is the first step to a goal. However, having certain capabilities is also key to success in performing specific tasks. I am very perceptive so I can notice elements that are out of the ordinary that may disrupt society and I also possess a sense of justice to act out this role. I can see myself right now in the uniform and looking out across the street. Perception is a necessary skill for all law enforcement. Without it, criminals would continue to wreak havoc and no one will be any the wiser. If a situation seems off, I will notice. I know the symptoms of being under the influence of hard drugs: drowsiness, hyperactivity, sweating, irritability, paranoia. Liars will not fool me either. I will note the delay and uncertainty in a person’s response and the many gestures that accompany deceit. Then I will politely ask for the truth. There is another sense that is required for this position. A sense of justice is a key component to upholding the law. The privilege of safeguarding other people can corrupt. Many act as if they are the rulers of the land but I would consider myself a servant of society. Abusing power is unthinkable to me. There are government workers who accept bribes and practice favoritism. I would treat all citizens as equals, not favoring the rich, a gender, or any particular ethnicity. This country is founded on principles of equality and should be enforced by only the fair-minded. Professions require a certain set of skills. Applicants that want to be police officers are weeded out first for the incapable. I have astute skills to notice illegal and abnormal activities and I also have a clear sense of justice. I know I will pass the training and perform well in the field. In the not too distant future, I will assist in keeping the country, the city, the people in uniform. Prompt: ? I was born in Guatemala. When I was about five years old my mother contacted some people and I’ve lived in Georgia ever since. Growing up was a real struggle. Bills were paid late, sometimes there was no dinner for me and my siblings, and eventually we would relocate to a different apartment. This happened several times until money was no longer an issue and we moved into a humble house. My brother had it the worst out of the three kids my mom had. There was always the language barrier, but he was lucky since the school actually bumped him up a grade. Even with all the stress he managed to graduate. My sister was a total different story, however. Greilyn was always involved in extracurricular activities, and throughout her high school years she had at least one Advanced Placement class. She would juggle sleep, homework, sports, and after school clubs all at once. She wasn’t able to attend college because she didn’t have legal papers at that time. My brother, my sister and I were able to get a worker’s permit two years ago and my sister and brother were able to get a stable job. Both Heber and Greilyn moved to Florida, my brother with his wife and my sister with her husband. Family problems arose back at home. When I was in seventh grade I started to miss a lot of days in school. Some teachers told me I wouldn’t get anywhere in life and that’s where I stopped caring about anything that had to deal with school. This was when life knocked the teeth straight out of my mouth. I would have mental breakdowns time after time. In the 10th grade, I barely passed the first semester and I failed four classes the second. When I got to my junior year in high school I realized how important school really was and I made a life plan to become a mechanical engineer. I moved to Florida with my sister for the first semester of 11th grade and that’s where I recovered my lost credits. I went from taking advanced classes to standard classes in less than a year. I didn’t give up there and I’m still here standing. I know my story is merely one of thousands, but nothing would mean more to me than being the first in my family to go to college and prove to myself that I am no failure. I have always believed that one cannot get back up if they have never fallen. I’m grabbing life by the horns and taming the raging beast. This is only the beginning, for one day I will also prove the world, and those who doubted me, that I  am a successful college graduate. As the window bust from the hard wind I Can feel the the heat rise as the flames spread extremely rapidly from the garage to the living room. The flames started in the garage it was caused by the wires in the walls the Fire department said it was an electrical fire. I can remember the harsh smell of wood burning that made my stomach ache. The heat of the fire felt liked when you open the oven after a long time of preheating. One of My Greatest challenges that I faces was my house burning to the ground in the spring of 2007. This experience Changed my life completely it showed me things about family and friends, Showed me to Value things more, but it also made life harder. It was 11:48Pm on a Wednesday night everybody was asleep except my brother he was up watching TV when he notice a burning smell coming from down stairs, he rushed to see where it was coming from when he notice the garage was in flames, He run upstairs panicking to wake everybody up. Once he thought everybody was up the flames was already spreading more and more. As we try and put on our shoes we hear window bursting one by one. We all rushed towards the front door were you could barely see anything because the house was filled with black smoke, as I inhaled the smoke I remember getting lite headed jumping out the fire. Then once everybody was out we notice my baby brother didn’t make it out. The fire man said it was too risky for anybody to go back in the house, even the fire marshal gave up on him. My older brother wasn’t going for it he broke loose from the fire man and ran fast thru the back yard to the back door and up the stairs as he heard my brother scream for help. He yells to my brother to just roll down the stairs. He rolls down the stairs and he and my baby brother jumped out the house together as soon as they jumped out the whole entire house collapse. My brother had 3rd degree burns in many places. They Fire department called him a miracle because they never seen somebody make it out a house like that. My family lost everything, 5 dogs all our clothes shoes furniture and pictures everything. At the end of the night we were placed in a hotel for those whom didn’t have a house. We stayed in a hotel for about 2 months until we finally moved back to Chicago for 2 months to stay with my grandma. After the fire everything was different crying myself to sleep every night waking up in tears having nightmares of that night, I felt like I was reliving it all over again night by night, Not going to school every day because we had no clothes or shoes. When my house burnt down I left my best friend she stayed in that neighborhood she was the only person to know and understand. At that time I didn’t care about school at all. Going to school and people asking about was the worst. People making fun of me because I didn’t have a house I hated school just because of that. Nobody could understand what I was going thru at a young age. Moving from hotel to hotel school to school I went to 5 different elementary schools a different school every year. Having to make new friends every year was hard being insecure of my situation to tell people was the hardest. I used to go to school just to go not even caring about it. Until my 5th grade year and I meet this teacher who was so cooled and I could talk to her bout everything and she made me realize school is what I need. She taught me I can just write my hurt and my problems out with poetry or just start writing when I’m upset. As time moved on things started getting better, we started getting our life back together. Started building a home back together getting everything back to normal, even though it was hard and we struggled but my mom always managed to get it done. We noticed family wasn’t always there for you when you need them. It was us by ourselves against everything all the problems with no help, even my mom mother wasn’t there after time went back. It showed us life can be gone in a blink of an eye. After that it made us stronger and closer as a family. It made us strive harder to get everything we wanted and once had because we lost it all in one night. It showed me that I need an education to be successful in order to get everything I want. Prompt: The lessons we take from failure can be fundamental to later success. Recount an incident or time when you experienced failure. How did it affect you, and what did you learn from the experience? High school is a great stepping ground for young adults to experience responsibility, freedom and to prepare themselves for college and the work field. Everyone makes mistakes but it’s up to you to correct them and better the situation. Having responsibilities is a huge thing to have. You always have to stay focused and on top of things. My freshmen year in high school I failed second semester Biology. I didn’t know how I was going to be able to make it up so that I could still graduate on time and have a good college look at me. I went to my counselor to ask her about any programs that the school offered for kids that failed classes. She offered me a chance to do a afterschool program called Credit Recovery. The program was $100 for two weeks and class was 3 hours long. Having to do Credit Recovery for those two weeks I still had to say on top of doing my classwork for school and working. Me failing Biology set me back but also made me realize how much school Is important to me and just how badly I wanted stay focused and do the right thing. Freedom can help or set you back in life, it’s up to you to keep everything in order and to still do what you’re supposed to do. For example wanting to go out with your friends, instead of studying for a quiz. I honestly think Prompt: Indicate a person who has had a significant influence on you, and describe that influence. From a young age my grandparents were always on my butt to go in a straight line, to stay focus, and to never do something I would regret in the future. My grandparents always had a huge influence in my life. To this day I can never be any more grateful to have them. The example they set is the example I want to set to the lower classmen. From 5 in the morning to 6 afternoons, Monday thru Friday they would come with tiredness written all over their face. Just knowing they’re busting their butts just so I can go to school and knowing I don’t have to worry about anything. Because of them I want to strive for success, I want to be someone with a doctor’s degree or a business degree, just something that they could be proud of. I was given an opportunity that wasn’t given to my grandparents and that was an education. I’ve face situations where dropping out was the easy way out, but why quit when I’m so close to getting a diploma, why quit on something my grandparents would be so happy about, why let them down, why not graduate so they can tell their friends and family that they raised a successful kid, a kid that didn’t give up. My grandparents would tell me “ if you want to be successful go for it, we would be by your side; nothing stopping you from being someone important in life.” It’s my senior year and its crazy to think that I made it this far, I’m the only one in my family that’s about to graduate, I’m breaking a curse that’s been in my family for generations. My grandparents are the reason for me to finish my education. Every day I would get lectured about what kind of life I would have if I don’t finish high school, I don’t want to be behind a lawn mower working 11 hours a day in the heat. Having an education open so many doors for different opportunities in the future. Prompt: Discuss the greatest challenge you have faced or expect to face Everyone has a challenge that they expect to face. My greatest challenge that I expect to face is going to college and being successful in the future. Those are my greatest challenge because it is not going to be easy. I am going to have to put a lot of effort and not mess up. Once you mess up it is very hard to get back up, and since it is about your future than it is very important to not make that mistake. It is not going to be easy because colleges do not just accept anybody. They require much information such as the SAT or the ACT. Which are a test that every college requires, and you have to meet the average point or above. Also a certain point of GPA and above, resume and other important requirements. College is the real thing, it is more freedom and that is where you already know what you want to do in life. You have your mind set on your career and at that moment you already know what you should do and expect to do. To be successful in my future I have to do something I enjoy doing and that gets me good money for it. I want to do entrepreneur, because I want to have my own business. I do not like it when people boss me around. Therefor if I study entrepreneur I would be the one bossing people around and they would work for me. I enjoy that because it something I like to do and I have always wanted to have my own business. In college I want to study entrepreneur, but it would not be easy. Even though it would not be easy I would not give up, it would be a great challenge for me. College is the time to get your things together and start working extra hard. It is not going to be easy but one should not give up. It would be extremely stressful and hard but that is just how college is. I am the type of person that gets distracted easily so I paying attention in college with no distractions would be a challenge. I would have to set up goals and learn how to accomplish each one of them. When you set up goals you have to be determined and find a way to achieve them. It is a lot to do but it is something I expect to face. Prompt: The greatest challenge I am expected to face. As a child I had almost everything handed to me. What I would ask for I received, I had six pets for crying out loud. As time prevailed getting what I wanted when I wanted wasn’t so easy anymore. Now it’s my last year of high school and it could not be any more stressful than it is now. It’s the last first day of high school I am struck with “senioritis” as soon as I walk through those double doors. Saying to myself “I can’t wait to graduate and get this year over with”. By May all of this will be over and I’ll be left to my own devices, by May all my friends would have moved on ,and I’ll be stuck thinking to my self what’s next? By May my time would be up Prompt: Discuss a place that has changed you. It’s a shame how few people choose not to go to college. I plan on going to college and have a bright future. One particular school I’ve been seeking is Morehouse. I plan on attending a school with a positive environment and fair rules. I have learned unique history and facts about the school as well. Not too long ago I visited Morehouse College my sophomore year. I was in this mentoring program called BEAMERS we went on a field trip to visit the school. This experience changed me. I remember stepping off that rusty bus into the quiet school. The halls were silent and echoed every step you took. The lunch room smelled like a 5-star restaurant. I said to myself: “I’d love to attend this school”. As soon as we made it to the college we sat in a class room then talked to a student that attends Morehouse. He told us the GPA requirements, which was a 3.7 at the time. He explained Morehouse is a private, four-year, historically black college. We were also informed that Morehouse was an all-male school. This statement was a shock to many including myself. The crazy thing was Spelman College was right across the street from Morehouse. Spellman was an all-female school. The student informed us with much information about the school but our tour was nowhere finished. The best part about our tour was coming up next. The student informed us with unique history of the school. There is an obelisk named in honor of Howard Thurman. Thurman was an African American author, philosopher, theologian, educator and civil rights leader. He was a graduate of Morehouse College. There were many other celebrities that graduated from this school such as Spike Lee, Samuel L. Jackson, and Martin Luther King Jr. Martin Luther King was enrolled at more at the age of 15 after skipping the 9th & 12th grade. These unique facts went on and on like a broken record. Ever since the Morehouse tour I’ve never been the same. I met the requirements to this college. I would be more than happy to attend it. I hope ever school high school gets to tour this college. It is truly a life changing experience. Prompt: Discuss the greatest challenge you have faced or expect to face. Throughout my entire life challenges have been with me from the beginning. No matter what I have faced challenges and been expecting to face more that are thrown my way. Without dealing with these situations in life I don’t think I would be as successful as I am now. Challenges to me are basically things to where I have to push myself in order to go where I want to go. Plus learning how to never give up and stay at the task at hand. The greatest challenge I expect to face in life is getting my mom and brother a bigger house and a better lifestyle for them. I really expect to do all that through basketball as a matter of fact and I have a great feeling that I will be able to accomplish this as well. Basketball is really my wife in this w"

195,The Rolling Stones,Beast Of Burden - Remastered,"                                             CHAPTER TWO                   THE VERDURINS QUARREL WITH M. DE CHARLUS    After dinner, I told Albertine that, since I was out of bed, I might as well take the opportunity to go and see some of my friends, Mme. de Villeparisis, Mme. de Guermantes, the Cambremers, anyone in short whom I might find at home. I omitted to mention only the people whom I did intend to see, the Verdurins. I asked her if she would not come with me. She pleaded that she had no suitable clothes. “Besides, my hair is so awful. Do you really wish me to go on doing it like this?” And by way of farewell she held out her hand to me in that abrupt fashion, the arm outstretched, the shoulders thrust back, which she used to adopt on the beach at Balbec and had since then entirely abandoned. This forgotten gesture retransformed the body which it animated into that of the Albertine who as yet scarcely knew me. It restored to Albertine, ceremonious beneath an air of rudeness, her first novelty, her strangeness, even her setting. I saw the sea behind this girl whom I had never seen shake hands with me in this fashion since I was at the seaside. “My aunt thinks it makes me older,” she added with a sullen air. “Oh that her aunt may be right!” thought I. “That Albertine by looking like a child should make Mme. Bontemps appear younger than she is, is all that her aunt would ask, and also that Albertine shall cost her nothing between now and the day when, by marrying me, she will repay what has been spent on her.” But that Albertine should appear less young, less pretty, should turn fewer heads in the street, that is what I, on the contrary, hoped. For the age of a duenna is less reassuring to a jealous lover than the age of the woman’s face whom he loves. I regretted only that the style in which I had asked her to do her hair should appear to Albertine an additional bolt on the door of her prison. And it was henceforward this new domestic sentiment that never ceased, even when I was parted from Albertine, to form a bond attaching me to her    I said to Albertine, who was not dressed, or so she told me, to accompany me to the Guermantes’ or the Cambremers’, that I could not be certain where I should go, and set off for the Verdurins’. At the moment when the thought of the concert that I was going to hear brought back to my mind the scene that afternoon: “Grand pied de grue, grand pied de grue,”— a scene of disappointed love, of jealous love perhaps, but if so as bestial as the scene to which a woman might be subjected by, so to speak, an orang-outang that was, if one may use the expression, in love with her — at the moment when, having reached the street, I was just going to hail a cab, I heard the sound of sobs which a man who was sitting upon a curbstone was endeavouring to stifle. I came nearer; the man, who had buried his face in his hands, appeared to be quite young, and I was surprised to see, from the gleam of white in the opening of his cloak, that he was wearing evening clothes and a white tie. As he heard my step he uncovered a face bathed in tears, but at once, having recognised me, turned away. It was Morel. He guessed that I had recognised him and, checking his tears with an effort, told me that he had stopped to rest for a moment, he was in such pain. “I have grossly insulted, only to-day,” he said, “a person for whom I had the very highest regard. It was a cowardly thing to do, for she loves me.” “She will forget perhaps, as time goes on,” I replied, without realising that by speaking thus I made it apparent that I had overheard the scene that afternoon. But he was so much absorbed in his own grief that it never even occurred to him that I might know something about the affair. “She may forget, perhaps,” he said. “But I myself can never forget. I am too conscious of my degradation, I am disgusted with myself! However, what I have said I have said, and nothing can unsay it. When people make me lose my temper, I don’t know what I am doing. And it is so bad for me, my nerves are all on edge,” for, like all neurasthenics, he was keenly interested in his own health. If, during the afternoon, I had witnessed the amorous rage of an infuriated animal, this evening, within a few hours, centuries had elapsed and a fresh sentiment, a sentiment of shame, regret, grief, shewed that a great stage had been passed in the evolution of the beast destined to be transformed into a human being. Nevertheless, I still heard ringing in my ears his ‘grand pied de grue‘ and dreaded an imminent return to the savage state. I had only a very vague impression, however, of what had been happening, and this was but natural, for M. de Charlus himself was totally unaware that for some days past, and especially that day, even before the shameful episode which was not a direct consequence of the violinist’s condition, Morel had been suffering from a recurrence of his neurasthenia. As a matter of fact, he had, in the previous month, proceeded as rapidly as he had been able, a great deal less rapidly than he would have liked, towards the seduction of Jupien’s niece with whom he was at liberty, now that they were engaged, to go out whenever he chose. But whenever he had gone a trifle far in his attempts at violation, and especially when he suggested to his betrothed that she might make friends with other girls whom she would then procure for himself, he had met with a resistance that made him furious. All at once (whether she would have proved too chaste, or on the contrary would have surrendered herself) his desire had subsided. He had decided to break with her, but feeling that the Baron, vicious as he might be, was far more moral than himself, he was afraid lest, in the event of a rupture, M. de Charlus might turn him out of the house. And so he had decided, a fortnight ago, that he would not see the girl again, would leave M. de Charlus and Jupien to clean up the mess (he employed a more realistic term) by themselves, and, before announcing the rupture, to ‘b ——-off’ to an unknown destination    For all that his conduct towards Jupien’s niece coincided exactly, in its minutest details, with the plan of conduct which he had outlined to the Baron as they were dining together at Saint-Mars le Vêtu, it is probable that his intention was entirely different, and that sentiments of a less atrocious nature, which he had not foreseen in his theory of conduct, had improved, had tinged it with sentiment in practice. The sole point in which, on the contrary, the practice was worse than the theory is this, that in theory it had not appeared to him possible that he could remain in Paris after such an act of betrayal. Now, on the contrary, actually to ‘b ——— off’ for so small a matter seemed to him quite unnecessary. It meant leaving the Baron who would probably be furious, and forfeiting his own position. He would lose all the money that the Baron was now giving him. The thought that this was inevitable made his nerves give away altogether, he cried for hours on end, and in order not to think about it any more dosed himself cautiously with morphine. Then suddenly he hit upon an idea which no doubt had gradually been taking shape in his mind and gaining strength there for some time, and this was that a rupture with the girl would not inevitably mean a complete break with M. de Charlus. To lose all the Baron’s money was a serious thing in itself. Morel in his uncertainty remained for some days a prey to dark thoughts, such as came to him at the sight of Bloch. Then he decided that Jupien and his niece had been trying to set a trap for him, that they might consider themselves lucky to be rid of him so cheaply. He found in short that the girl had been in the wrong in being so clumsy, in not having managed to keep him attached to her by a sensual attraction. Not only did the sacrifice of his position with M. de Charlus seem to him absurd, he even regretted the expensive dinners he had given the girl since they became engaged, the exact cost of which he knew by heart, being a true son of the valet who used to bring his ‘book’ every month for my uncle’s inspection. For the word book, in the singular, which means a printed volume to humanity in general, loses that meaning among Royal Princes and servants. To the latter it means their housekeeping book, to the former the register in which we inscribe our names. (At Balbec one day when the Princesse de Luxembourg told me that she had not brought a book with her, I was about to offer her Le Pêcheur d’Islande and Tartarîn de Tarascon, when I realised that she had meant not that she would pass the time less agreeably, but that I should find it more difficult to pay a call upon her.)    Notwithstanding the change in Morel’s point of view with regard to the consequences of his behaviour, albeit that behaviour would have seemed to him abominable two months earlier, when he was passionately in love with Jupien’s niece, whereas during the last fortnight he had never ceased to assure himself that the same behaviour was natural, praiseworthy, it continued to intensify the state of nervous unrest in which, finally, he had announced the rupture that afternoon. And he was quite prepared to vent his anger, if not (save in a momentary outburst) upon the girl, for whom he still felt that lingering fear, the last trace of love, at any rate upon the Baron. He took care, however, not to say anything to him before dinner, for, valuing his own professional skill above everything, whenever he had any difficult music to play (as this evening at the Verdurins’) he avoided (as far as possible, and the scene that afternoon was already more than ample) anything that might impair the flexibility of his wrists. Similarly a surgeon who is an enthusiastic motorist, does not drive when he has an operation to perform. This accounts to me for the fact that, while he was speaking to me, he kept bending his fingers gently one after another to see whether they had regained their suppleness. A slight frown seemed to indicate that there was still a trace of nervous stiffness. But, so as not to increase it, he relaxed his features, as we forbid ourself to grow irritated at not being able to sleep or to prevail upon a woman, for fear lest our rage itself may retard the moment of sleep or of satisfaction. And so, anxious to regain his serenity so that he might, as was his habit, absorb himself entirely in what he was going to play at the Verdurins’, and anxious, so long as I was watching him, to let me see how unhappy he was, he decided that the simplest course was to beg me to leave him immediately. His request was superfluous, and it was a relief to me to get away from him. I had trembled lest, as we were due at the same house, within a few minutes, he might ask me to take him with me, my memory of the scene that afternoon being too vivid not to give me a certain distaste for the idea of having Morel by my side during the drive. It is quite possible that the love, and afterwards the indifference or hatred felt by Morel for Jupien’s niece had been sincere. Unfortunately, it was not the first time that he had behaved thus, that he had suddenly ‘dropped’ a girl to whom he had sworn undying love, going so far as to produce a loaded revolver, telling her that he would blow out his brains if ever he was mean enough to desert her. He did nevertheless desert her in time, and felt instead of remorse, a sort of rancour against her. It was not the first time that he had behaved thus, it was not to be the last, with the result that the heads of many girls — girls less forgetful of him than he was of them — suffered — as Jupien’s niece’s head continued long afterwards to suffer, still in love with Morel although she despised him — suffered, ready to burst with the shooting of an internal pain because in each of them — like a fragment of a Greek carving — an aspect of Morel’s face, hard as marble and beautiful as an antique sculpture, was embedded in her brain, with his blossoming hair, his fine eyes, his straight nose, forming a protuberance in a cranium not shaped to receive it, upon which no operation was possible. But in the fulness of time these stony fragments end by slipping into a place where they cause no undue discomfort, from which they never stir again; we are no longer conscious of their presence: I mean forgetfulness, or an indifferent memory    Meanwhile I had gained two things in the course of the day. On the one hand, thanks to the calm that was produced in me by Albertine’s docility, I found it possible, and therefore made up my mind, to break with her. There was on the other hand, the fruit of my reflexions during the interval that I had spent waiting for her, at the piano, the idea that Art, to which I would try to devote my reconquered liberty, was not a thing that justified one in making a sacrifice, a thing above and beyond life, that did not share in its fatuity and futility; the appearance of real individuality obtained in works of art being due merely to the illusion created by the artist’s technical skill. If my afternoon had left behind it other deposits, possibly more profound, they were not to come to my knowledge until much later. As for the two which I was able thus to weigh, they were not to be permanent; for, from this very evening my ideas about art were to rise above the depression to which they had been subjected in the afternoon, while on the other hand my calm, and consequently the freedom that would enable me to devote myself to it, was once again to be withdrawn from me    As my cab, following the line of the embankment, was coming near the Verdurins’ house, I made the driver pull up. I had just seen Brichot alighting from the tram at the foot of the Rue Bonaparte, after which he dusted his shoes with an old newspaper and put on a pair of pearl grey gloves. I went up to him on foot. For some time past, his sight having grown steadily weaker, he had been endowed — as richly as an observatory — with new spectacles of a powerful and complicated kind, which, like astronomical instruments, seemed to be screwed into his eyes; he focussed their exaggerated blaze upon myself and recognised me. They — the spectacles — were in marvellous condition. But behind them I could see, minute, pallid, convulsive, expiring, a remote gaze placed under this powerful apparatus, as, in a laboratory equipped out of all proportion to the work that is done in it, you may watch the last throes of some insignificant animalcule through the latest and most perfect type of microscope. I offered him my arm to guide him on his way. “This time it is not by great Cherbourg that we meet,” he said to me, “but by little Dunkerque,” a remark which I found extremely tiresome, as I failed to understand what he meant; and yet I dared not ask Brichot, dreading not so much his scorn as his explanations. I replied that I was longing to see the room in which Swann used to meet Odette every evening. “What, so you know that old story, do you?” he said. “And yet from those days to the death of Swann is what the poet rightly calls: ‘Grande spatium mortalis aevi.’”    The death of Swann had been a crushing blow to me at the time. The death of Swann! Swann, in this phrase, is something more than a noun in the possessive case. I mean by it his own particular death, the death allotted by destiny to the service of Swann. For we talk of ‘death’ for convenience, but there are almost as many different deaths as there are people. We are not equipped with a sense that would enable us to see, moving at every speed in every direction, these deaths, the active deaths aimed by destiny at this person or that. Often there are deaths that will not be entirely relieved of their duties until two or even three years later. They come in haste to plant a tumour in the side of a Swann, then depart to attend to their other duties, returning only when, the surgeons having performed their operation, it is necessary to plant the tumour there afresh. Then comes the moment when we read in the Gaulois that Swann’s health has been causing anxiety but that he is now making an excellent recovery. Then, a few minutes before the breath leaves our body, death, like a sister of charity who has come to nurse, rather than to destroy us, enters to preside over our last moments, crowns with a supreme halo the cold and stiffening creature whose heart has ceased to beat. And it is this diversity among deaths, the mystery of their circuits, the colour of their fatal badge, that makes so impressive a paragraph in the newspapers such as this:     “We regret to learn that M. Charles Swann passed away yesterday at his residence in Paris, after a long and painful illness. A Parisian whose intellectual gifts were widely appreciated, a discriminating but steadfastly loyal friend, he will be universally regretted, in those literary and artistic circles where the soundness and refinement of his taste made him a willing and a welcome guest, as well as at the Jockey Club of which he was one of the oldest and most respected members. He belonged also to the Union and Agricole. He had recently resigned his membership of the Rue Royale. His personal appearance and eminently distinguished bearing never failed to arouse public interest at all the great events of the musical and artistic seasons, especially at private views, at which he was a regular attendant until, during the last years of his life, he became almost entirely confined to the house. The funeral will take place, etc.”    From this point of view, if one is not ‘somebody,’ the absence of a well known title makes the process of decomposition even more rapid. No doubt it is more or less anonymously, without any personal identity, that a man still remains Duc d’Uzès. But the ducal coronet does for some time hold the elements together, as their moulds keep together those artistically designed ices which Albertine admired, whereas the names of ultra-fashionable commoners, as soon as they are dead, dissolve and lose their shape. We have seen M. de Bréauté speak of Cartier as the most intimate friend of the Duc de La Trémoïlle, as a man greatly in demand in aristocratic circles. To a later generation, Cartier has become something so formless that it would almost be adding to his importance to make him out as related to the jeweller Cartier, with whom he would have smiled to think that anybody could be so ignorant as to confuse him! Swann on the contrary was a remarkable personality, in both the intellectual and the artistic worlds; and even although he had ‘produced’ nothing, still he had a chance of surviving a little longer. And yet, my dear Charles ——-, whom I used to know when I was still so young and you were nearing your grave, it is because he whom you must have regarded as a little fool has made you the hero of one of his volumes that people are beginning to speak of you again and that your name will perhaps live. If in Tissot’s picture representing the balcony of the Rue Royale club, where you figure with Galliffet, Edmond Polignac and Saint-Maurice, people are always drawing attention to yourself, it is because they know that there are some traces of you in the character of Swann    To return to more general realities, it was of this foretold and yet unforeseen death of Swann that I had heard him speak himself to the Duchesse de Guermantes, on the evening of her cousin’s party. It was the same death whose striking and specific strangeness had recurred to me one evening when, as I ran my eye over the newspaper, my attention was suddenly arrested by the announcement of it, as though traced in mysterious lines interpolated there out of place. They had sufficed to make of a living man some one who can never again respond to what you say to him, to reduce him to a mere name, a written name, that has passed in a moment from the real world to the realm of silence. It was they that even now made me anxious to make myself familiar with the house in which the Verdurins had lived, and where Swann, who at that time was not merely a row of five letters printed in a newspaper, had dined so often with Odette. I must add also (and this is what for a long time made Swann’s death more painful than any other, albeit these reasons bore no relation to the individual strangeness of his death) that I had never gone to see Gilberte, as I promised him at the Princesse de Guermantes’s, that he had never told me what the ‘other reason’ was, to which he alluded that evening, for his selecting me as the recipient of his conversation with the Prince, that a thousand questions occurred to me (as bubbles rise from the bottom of a pond) which I longed to ask him about the most different subjects: Vermeer, M. de Mouchy, Swann himself, a Boucher tapestry, Combray, questions that doubtless were not very vital since I had put off asking them from day to day, but which seemed to me of capital importance now that, his lips being sealed, no answer would ever come     “No,” Brichot went on, “it was not here that Swann met his future wife, or rather it was here only in the very latest period, after the disaster that partially destroyed Mme. Verdurin’s former home.”    Unfortunately, in my fear of displaying before the eyes of Brichot an extravagance which seemed to me out of place, since the professor had no share in its enjoyment, I had alighted too hastily from the carriage and the driver had not understood the words I had flung at him over my shoulder in order that I might be well clear of the carriage before Brichot caught sight of me. The consequence was that the driver followed us and asked me whether he was to call for me later; I answered hurriedly in the affirmative, and was regarded with a vastly increased respect by the professor who had come by omnibus     “Ah! So you were in a carriage,” he said in solemn tones. “Only by the purest accident. I never take one as a rule. I always travel by omnibus or on foot. However, it may perhaps entitle me to the great honour of taking you home to-night if you will oblige me by consenting to enter that rattletrap; we shall be packed rather tight. But you are always so considerate to me.” Alas, in making him this offer, I am depriving myself of nothing (I reflected) since in any case I shall be obliged to go home for Albertine’s sake. Her presence in my house, at an hour when nobody could possibly call to see her, allowed me to dispose as freely of my time as I had that afternoon, when, seated at the piano, I knew that she was on her way back from the Trocadéro and that I was in no hurry to see her again. But furthermore, as also in the afternoon, I felt that I had a woman in the house and that on returning home I should not taste the fortifying thrill of solitude. “I accept with great good will,” replied Brichot. “At the period to which you allude, our friends occupied in the Rue Montalivet a magnificent ground floor apartment with an upper landing, and a garden behind, less sumptuous of course, and yet to my mind preferable to the old Venetian Embassy.” Brichot informed me that this evening there was to be at ‘Quai Conti’ (thus it was that the faithful spoke of the Verdurin drawing-room since it had been transferred to that address) a great musical ‘tow-row-row’ got up by M. de Charlus. He went on to say that in the old days to which I had referred, the little nucleus had been different, and its tone not at all the same, not only because the faithful had then been younger. He told me of elaborate jokes played by Elstir (what he called ‘pure buffooneries’), as for instance one day when the painter, having pretended to fail at the last moment, had come disguised as an extra waiter and, as he handed round the dishes, whispered gallant speeches in the ear of the extremely proper Baroness Putbus, crimson with anger and alarm; then disappearing before the end of dinner he had had a hip-bath carried into the drawing-room, out of which, when the party left the table, he had emerged stark naked uttering fearful oaths; and also of supper parties to which the guests came in paper costumes, designed, cut out and coloured by Elstir, which were masterpieces in themselves, Brichot having worn on one occasion that of a great nobleman of the court of Charles VII, with long turned-up points to his shoes, and another time that of Napoleon I, for which Elstir had fashioned a Grand Cordon of the Legion of Honour out of sealing-wax. In short Brichot, seeing again with the eyes of memory the drawing-room of those days with its high windows, its low sofas devoured by the midday sun which had had to be replaced, declared that he preferred it to the drawing-room of to-day. Of course, I quite understood that by ‘drawing-room’ Brichot meant — as the word church implies not merely the religious edifice but the congregation of worshippers — not merely the apartment, but the people who visited it, the special pleasures that they came to enjoy there, to which, in his memory, those sofas had imparted their form upon which, when you called to see Mme. Verdurin in the afternoon, you waited until she was ready, while the blossom on the horse chestnuts outside, and on the mantelpiece carnations in vases seemed, with a charming and kindly thought for the visitor expressed in the smiling welcome of their rosy hues, to be watching anxiously for the tardy appearance of the lady of the house. But if the drawing-room seemed to him superior to what it was now, it was perhaps because our mind is the old Proteus who cannot remain the slave of any one shape and, even in the social world, suddenly abandons a house which has slowly and with difficulty risen to the pitch of perfection to prefer another which is less brilliant, just as the ‘touched-up’ photographs which Odette had had taken at Otto’s, in which she queened it in a ‘princess’ gown, her hair waved by Lenthéric, did not appeal to Swann so much as a little ‘cabinet picture’ taken at Nice, in which, in a cloth cape, her loosely dressed hair protruding beneath a straw hat trimmed with pansies and a bow of black ribbon, instead of being twenty years younger (for women as a rule look all the older in a photograph, the earlier it is), she looked like a little servant girl twenty years older than she now was. Perhaps too he derived some pleasure from praising to me what I myself had never known, from shewing me that he had tasted delights that I could never enjoy. If so, he was successful, for merely by mentioning the names of two or three people who were no longer alive and to each of whom he imparted something mysterious by his way of referring to them, to that delicious intimacy, he made me ask myself what it could have been like; I felt that everything that had been told me about the Verdurins was far too coarse; and indeed, in the case of Swann whom I had known, I reproached myself with not having paid him sufficient attention, with not having paid attention to him in a sufficiently disinterested spirit, with not having listened to him properly when he used to entertain me while we waited for his wife to come home for luncheon and he shewed me his treasures, now that I knew that he was to be classed with the most brilliant talkers of the past. Just as we were coming to Mme. Verdurin’s doorstep, I caught sight of M. de Charlus, steering towards us the bulk of his huge body, drawing unwillingly in his wake one of those blackmailers or mendicants who nowadays, whenever he appeared, sprang up without fail even in what were to all appearance the most deserted corners, by whom this powerful monster was, evidently against his will, invariably escorted, although at a certain distance, as is the shark by its pilot, in short contrasting so markedly with the haughty stranger of my first visit to Balbec, with his stern aspect, his affectation of virility, that I seemed to be discovering, accompanied by its satellite, a planet at a wholly different period of its revolution, when one begins to see it full, or a sick man now devoured by the malady which a few years ago was but a tiny spot which was easily concealed and the gravity of which was never suspected. Although the operation that Brichot had undergone had restored a tiny portion of the sight which he had thought to be lost for ever, I do not think he had observed the ruffian following in the Baron’s steps. Not that this mattered, for, ever since la Raspelière, and notwithstanding the professor’s friendly regard for M. de Charlus, the sight of the latter always made him feel ill at ease. No doubt to every man the life of every other extends along shadowy paths which he does not suspect. Falsehood, however, so often treacherous, upon which all conversation is based, conceals less perfectly a feeling of hostility, or of sordid interest, or a visit which we wish to look as though we had not paid, or an escapade with the mistress of a day which we are anxious to keep from our wife, than a good reputation covers up — so as not to let their existence be guessed — evil habits. They may remain unknown to us for a lifetime; an accidental encounter upon a pier, at night, will disclose them; even then this accidental discovery is frequently misunderstood and we require a third person, who is in the secret, to supply the unimaginable clue of which everyone is unaware. But, once we know about them, they alarm us because we feel that that way madness lies, far more than by their immorality. Mme. de Surgis did not possess the slightest trace of any moral feeling, and would have admitted anything of her sons that could be degraded and explained by material interest, which is comprehensible to all mankind! But she forbade them to go on visiting M. de Charlus when she learned that, by a sort of internal clockwork, he was inevitably drawn upon each of their visits, to pinch their chins and to make each of them pinch his brother’s. She felt that uneasy sense of a physical mystery which makes us ask ourself whether the neighbour with whom we have been on friendly terms is not tainted with cannibalism, and to the Baron’s repeated inquiry: “When am I going to see your sons again?” she would reply, conscious of the thunderbolts that she was attracting to her defenceless head, that they were very busy working for examinations, preparing to go abroad, and so forth. Irresponsibility aggravates faults, and even crimes, whatever anyone may say. Landru (assuming that he really did kill his wives) if he did so from a financial motive, which it is possible to resist, may be pardoned, but not if his crime was due to an irresistible Sadism    Brichot’s coarse pleasantries, in the early days of his friendship with the Baron, had given place, as soon as it was a question, not of uttering commonplaces, but of understanding, to an awkward feeling which concealed a certain merriment. He reassured himself by recalling pages of Plato, lines of Virgil, because, being mentally as well as physically blind, he did not understand that in those days to fall in love with a young man was like, in our day (Socrates’s jokes reveal this more clearly than Plato’s theories), keeping a dancing girl before one marries and settles down. M. de Charlus himself would not have understood, he who confused his mania with friendship, which does not resemble it in the least, and the athletes of Praxiteles with obliging boxers. He refused to see that for the last nineteen hundred years (“a pious courtier under a pious prince would have been an atheist under an atheist prince,” as Labruyère reminds us) all conventional homosexuality — that of Plato’s young friends as well as that of Virgil’s shepherds — has disappeared, that what survives and increases is only the involuntary, the neurotic kind, which we conceal from other people and disguise to ourselves. And M. de Charlus would have been wrong in not denying frankly the pagan genealogy. In exchange for a little plastic beauty, how vast the moral superiority! The shepherd in Theocritus who sighs for love of a boy, later on will have no reason to be less hard of heart, less dull of wit than the other shepherd whose flute sounds for Amaryllis. For the former is not suffering from a malady, he is conforming to the customs of his time. It is the homosexuality that survives in spite of obstacles, a thing of scorn and loathing, that is the only true form, the only form that can be found conjoined in a person with an enhancement of his moral qualities. We are appalled at the apparently close relation between these and our bodily attributes, when we think of the slight dislocation of a purely physical taste, the slight blemish in one of the senses, which explain why the world of poets and musicians, so firmly barred against the Duc de Guermantes, opens its portals to M. de Charlus. That the latter should shew taste in the furnishing of his home, which is that of an eclectic housewife, need not surprise us; but the narrow loophole that opens upon Beethoven and Veronese! This does not exempt the sane from a feeling of alarm when a madman who has composed a sublime poem, after explaining to them in the most logical fashion that he has been shut up by mistake, through his wife’s machinations, imploring them to intercede for him with the governor of the asylum, complaining of the promiscuous company that is forced upon him, concludes as follows: “You see that man who is waiting to speak to me on the lawn, whom I am obliged to put up with; he thinks that he is Jesus Christ. That alone will shew you the sort of lunatics that I have to live among; he cannot be Christ, for I am Christ myself!” A moment earlier, you were on the point of going to assure the governor that a mistake had been made. At this final speech, even if you bear in mind the admirable poem at which this same man is working every day, you shrink from him, as Mme. de Surgis’s sons shrank from M. de Charlus, not that he would have done them any harm, but because of his ceaseless invitations, the ultimate purpose of which was to pinch their chins. The poet is to be pitied, who must, with no Virgil to guide him, pass through the circles of an inferno of sulphur and brimstone, to cast himself into the fire that falls from heaven, in order to rescue a few of the inhabitants of Sodom! No charm in his work; the same severity in his life as in those of the unfrocked priests who follow the strictest rule of celibacy so that no one may be able to ascribe to anything but loss of faith their discarding of the cassock    Making a pretence of not seeing the seedy individual who was following in his wake (whenever the Baron ventured into the Boulevards or crossed the waiting-room in Saint-Lazarre station, these followers might be counted by the dozen who, in the hope of ‘touching him for a dollar,’ never let him out of their sight), and afraid at the same time that the other might have the audacity to accost him, the Baron had devoutly lowered his darkened eyelids which, in contrast to his rice-powdered cheeks, gave him the appearance of a Grand Inquisitor painted by El Greco. But this priestly expression caused alarm, and he looked like an unfrocked priest, various compromises to which he had been driven by the need to apologise for his taste and to keep it secret having had the effect of bringing to the surface of his face precisely what the Baron sought to conceal, a debauched life indicated by moral decay. This last, indeed, whatever be its cause, is easily detected, for it is never slow in taking bodily form and proliferates upon a face, especially on the cheeks and round the eyes, as physically as the ochreous yellows accumulate there in a case of jaundice or repulsive reds in a case of skin disease. Nor was it merely in the cheeks, or rather the chaps of this painted face, in the mammiferous chest, the aggressive rump of this body allowed to deteriorate and invaded by obesity, upon which there now floated iridescent as a film of oil, the vice at one time so jealously confined by M. de Charlus in the most secret chamber of his heart. Now it overflowed in all his speech     “So this is how you prowl the streets at night, Brichot, with a good-looking young man,” he said as he joined us, while the disappointed ruffian made off. “A fine example. We must tell your young pupils at the Sorbonne that this is how you behave. But, I must say, the society of youth seems to be good for you, Monsieur le Professeur, you are as fresh as a rosebud. I have interrupted you, you looked as though you were enjoying yourselves like a pair of giddy girls, and had no need of an old Granny Killjoy like myself. I shan’t take it to the confessional, since you are almost at your destination.” The Baron’s mood was all the more blithe since he knew nothing whatever about the scene that afternoon, Jupien having decided that it was better to protect his niece against a repetition of the onslaught than to inform M. de Charlus. And so the Baron was still looking forward to the marriage, and delighting in the thought of it. One would suppose that it is a consolation to these great solitaries to give their tragic celibacy the relief of a fictitious fatherhood. “But, upon my word, Brichot,” he went on, turning with a laugh to gaze at us, “I feel quite awkward when I see you in such gallant company. You were like a pair of lovers. Going along arm in arm, I say, Brichot, you do go the pace!” Ought one to ascribe this speech to the senility of a particular state of mind, less capable than in the past of controlling its reflexes, which in moments of automatism lets out a secret that has been so carefully hidden for forty years? Or rather to that contempt for plebeian opinion which all the Guermantes felt in their hearts, and of which M. de Charlus’s brother, the Duke, was displaying a variant form when, regardless of the fact that my mother could see him, he used to shave standing by his bedroom window in his unbuttoned nightshirt. Had M. de Charlus contracted, during the roasting journeys between Doncières and Douville, the dangerous habit of making himself at ease, and, just as he would push back his straw hat in order to cool his huge forehead, of unfastening — at first, for a few moments only — the mask that for too long had been rigorously imposed upon his true face? His conjugal attitude towards Morel might well have astonished anyone who had observed it in its full extent. But M. de Charlus had reached the stage when the monotony of the pleasures that his vice has to offer became wearying. He had sought instinctively for novel displays, and, growing tired of the strangers whom he picked up, had passed to the opposite pole, to what he used to imagine that he would always loathe, the imitation of family life, or of fatherhood. Sometimes even this did not suffice him, he required novelty, and would go and spend the night with a woman, just as a normal man may, once in his life, have wished to go to bed with a boy, from a curiosity similar though inverse, and in either case equally unhealthy. The Baron’s existence as one of the ‘faithful,’ living, for Charlie’s sake, entirely among the little clan, had had, in stultifying the efforts that he had been making for years to keep up lying appearances, the same influence that a voyage of exploration or residence in the colonies has upon certain Europeans who discard the ruling principles by which they were guided at home. And yet, the internal revolution of a mind, ignorant at first of the anomaly contained in its body, then appalled at it after the discovery, and finally growing so used to it as to fail to perceive that it is not safe to confess to other people what the sinner has come in time to confess without shame to himself, had been even more effective in liberating M. de Charlus from the last vestiges of social constraint than the time that he spent at the Verdurins’. No banishment, indeed, to the South Pole, or to the summit of Mont Blanc, can separate us so entirely from our fellow creatures as a prolonged residence in the seclusion of a secret vice, that is to say of a state of mind that is different from theirs. A vice (so M. de Charlus used at one time to style it) to which the Baron now gave the genial aspect of a mere failing, extremely common, attractive on the whole and almost amusing, like laziness, absent-mindedness or greed. Conscious of the curiosity that his own striking personality aroused, M. de Charlus derived a certain pleasure from satisfying, whetting, sustaining it. Just as a Jewish journalist will come forward day after day as the champion of Catholicism, not, probably, with any hope of being taken seriously, but simply in order not to disappoint the good-natured amusement of his readers, M. de Charlus would genially denounce evil habits among the little clan, as he would have mimicked a person speaking English or imitated Mounet-Sully, without waiting to be asked, so as to pay his scot with a good grace, by displaying an amateur talent in society; so that M. de Charlus now threatened Brichot that he would report to the Sorbonne that he was in the habit of walking about with young men, exactly as the circumcised scribe keeps referring in and out of season to the ‘Eldest Daughter of the Church’ and the ‘Sacred Heart of Jesus,’ that is to say without the least trace of hypocrisy, but with a distinctly histrionic effect. It was not only the change in the words themselves, so different from those that he allowed himself to use in the past, that seemed to require some explanation, there was also the change that had occurred in his intonations, his gestures, all of which now singularly resembled the type M. de Charlus used most fiercely to castigate; he would now utter unconsciously almost the same little cries (unconscious in him, and all the more deep-rooted) as are uttered consciously by the inverts who refer to one another as ‘she’; as though this deliberate ‘camping,’ against which M. de Charlus had for so long set his face, were after all merely a brilliant and faithful imitation of the manner that men of the Charlus type, whatever they may say, are compelled to adopt when they have reached a certain stage in their malady, just as sufferers from general paralysis or locomotor ataxia inevitably end by displaying certain symptoms. As a matter of fact — and this is what this purely unconscious ‘camping’ revealed — the difference between the stern Charlus, dressed all in black, with his stiffly brushed hair, whom I had known, and the painted young men, loaded with rings, was no more than the purely imaginary difference that exists between an excited person who talks fast, keeps moving all the time, and a neurotic who talks slowly, preserves a perpetual phlegm, but is tainted with the same neurasthenia in the eyes of the physician who knows that each of the two is devoured by the same anguish and marred by the same defects. At the same time one could tell that M. de Charlus had aged from wholly different signs, such as the extraordinary frequency in his conversation of certain expressions that had taken root in it and used now to crop up at every moment (for instance: ‘the chain of circumstances’) upon which the Baron’s speech leaned in sentence after sentence as upon a necessary prop. “Is Charlie here yet?” Brichot asked M. de Charlus as we came in sight of the door. “Oh, I don’t know,” said the Baron, raising his arms and half-shutting his eyes with the air of a person who does not wish anyone to accuse him of being indiscreet, all the more so as he had probably been reproached by Morel for things which he had said and which the other, as timorous as he was vain, and as ready to deny M. de Charlus as he was to boast of his friendship, had considered serious albeit they were quite unimportant. “You know, he never tells me what he’s going to do.” If the conversations of two people bound by a tie of intimacy are full of falsehood, this occurs no less spontaneously in the conversations that a third person holds with a lover on the subject of the person with whom the latter is in love, whatever be the sex of that person     “Have you seen him lately?” I asked M. de Charlus, with the object of seeming at once not to be afraid of mentioning Morel to him and not to believe that they were actually living together. “He came in, as it happened, for five minutes this morning while I was still half asleep, and sat down on the side of my bed, as though he wanted to ravish me.” I guessed at once that M. de Charlus had seen Charlie within the last hour, for if we ask a woman when she last saw the man whom we know to be — and whom she may perhaps suppose that we suspect of being — her lover, if she has just taken tea with him, she replies: “I saw him for an instant before luncheon.” Between these two incidents the only difference is that one is false and the other true, but both are equally innocent, or, if you prefer it, equally culpable. And so we should be unable to understand why the mistress (in this case, M. de Charlus) always chooses the false version, did we not know that such replies are determined, unknown to the person who utters them, by a number of factors which appear so out of proportion to the triviality of the incident that we do not take the trouble to consider them. But to a physicist the space occupied by the tiniest ball of pith is explained by the harmony of action, the conflict or equilibrium, of laws of attraction or repulsion which govern far greater worlds. Just as many different laws acting in opposite directions dictate the more general responses with regard to the innocence, the ‘platonism,’ or on the contrary the carnal reality of the relations that one has with the person whom one says one saw in the morning when one has seen him or her in the evening. Here we need merely record, without pausing to consider them, the desire to appear natural and fearless, the instinctive impulse to conceal a secret assignation, a blend of modesty and ostentation, the need to confess what one finds so delightful and to shew that one is loved, a divination of what the other person knows or guesses — but does not say — a divination which, exceeding or falling short of the other person’s, makes one now exaggerate, now under-estimate it, the spontaneous longing to play with fire and the determination to rescue something from the blaze. At the same time, speaking generally, let us say that M. de Charlus, notwithstanding the aggravation of his malady which perpetually urged him to reveal, to insinuate, sometimes boldly to invent compromising details, did intend, during this period in his life, to make it known that Charlie was not a man of the same sort as himself and that they were friends and nothing more. This did not prevent him (even though it may quite possibly have been true) from contradicting himself at times (as with regard to the hour at which they had last met), whether he forgot himself at such moments and told the truth, or invented a lie, boastingly or from a sentimental affectation or because he thought it amusing to baffle his questioner. “You know that he is to me,” the Baron went on, “the best of comrades, for whom I have the greatest affection, as I am certain” (was he uncertain of it, then, that he felt the need to say that he was certain?) “he has for me, but there is nothing at all between us, nothing of that sort, you understand, nothing of that sort,” said the Baron, as naturally as though he had been speaking of a woman. “Yes, he came in this morning to pull me out of bed. Though he knows that I hate anybody to see me in bed. You don’t mind? Oh, it’s horrible, it’s so disturbing, one looks so perfectly hideous, of course I’m no longer five-and-twenty, they won’t choose me to be Queen of the May, still one does like to feel that one is looking one’s best.”    It is possible that the Baron was in earnest when he spoke of Morel as a good comrade, and that he was being even more truthful than he supposed when he said: “I never know what he’s doing; he tells me nothing about his life.”    Indeed we may mention (interrupting for a few moments our narrative, which shall be resumed immediately after the closure of this parenthesis which opens at the moment when M. de Charlus, Brichot and myself are arriving at Mme. Verdurin’s front door), we may mention that shortly before this evening the Baron had been plunged in grief and stupefaction by a letter which he had opened by mistake and which was addressed to Morel. This letter, which by a repercussion was to cause intense misery to myself also, was written by the actress Léa, notorious for her exclusive interest in women. And yet her letter to Morel (whom M. de Charlus had never suspected of knowing her, even) was written in the most impassioned tone. Its indelicacy prevents us from reproducing it here, but we may mention that Léa addressed him throughout in the feminine gender, with such expressions as: “Go on, you bad woman!” or “Of course you are so, my pretty, you know you are.” And in this letter reference was made to various other women who seemed to be no less Morel’s friends than Léa’s. On the other hand, Morel’s sarcasm at the Baron’s expense and Léa’s at that of an officer who was keeping her, and of whom she said: “He keeps writing me letters begging me to be careful! What do you say to that, my little white puss,” revealed to M. de Charlus a state of things no less unsuspected by him than were Morel’s peculiar and intimate relations with Léa. What most disturbed the Baron was the word ‘so.’ Ignorant at first of its application, he had eventually, at a time already remote in the past, learned that he himself was ‘so.’ And now the notion that he had acquired of this word was again put to the challenge. When he had discovered that he was ‘so,’ he had supposed this to mean that his tastes, as Saint-Simon says, did not lie in the direction of women. And here was this word ‘so’ applied to Morel with an extension of meaning of which M. de Charlus was unaware, so much so that Morel gave proof, according to this letter, of his being ‘so’ by having the same taste as certain women for other women. From that moment the Baron’s jealousy had no longer any reason to confine itself to the men of Morel’s acquaintance, but began to extend to the women also. So that the people who were ‘so’ were not merely those that he had supposed to be ‘so,’ but a whole and vast section of the inhabitants of the planet, consisting of women as well as of men, loving not merely men but women also, and the Baron, in the face of this novel meaning of a word that was so familiar to him, felt himself tormented by an anxiety of the mind as well as of the heart, born of this twofold mystery which combined an extension of the field of his jealousy with the sudden inadequacy of a definition    M. de Charlus had never in his life been anything but an amateur. That is to say, incidents of this sort could never be of any use to him. He worked off the painful impression that they might make upon him in violent scenes in which he was a past-master of eloquence, or in crafty intrigues. But to a person endowed with the qualities of a Bergotte, for instance, they might have been of inestimable value. This may indeed explain, to a certain extent (since we have to grope blindfold, but choose, like the lower animals, the herb that is good for us), why men like Bergotte have generally lived in the company of persons who were ordinary, false and malicious. Their beauty is sufficient for the writer’s imagination, enhances his generosity, but does not in any way alter the nature of his companion, whose life, situated thousands of feet below the level of his own, her incredible stories, her lies carried farther, and, what is more, in another direction than what might have been expected, appear in occasional flashes. The lie, the perfect lie, about people whom we know, about the relations that we have had with them, about our motive for some action, a motive which we express in totally different terms, the lie as to what we are, whom we love, what we feel with regard to the person who loves us and believes that she has fashioned us in her own image because she keeps on kissing us morning, noon and night, that lie is one of the only things in the world that can open a window for us upon what is novel, unknown, that can awaken in us sleeping senses to the contemplation of universes that otherwise we should never have known. We are bound to say, in so far as M. de Charlus is concerned, that, if he was stupefied to learn with regard to Morel a certain number of things which the latter had carefully concealed from him, he was not justified in concluding from this that it was a mistake to associate too closely with the lower orders. We shall indeed see, in the concluding section of this work, M. de Charlus himself engaged in doing things which would have stupefied the members of his family and his friends far more than he could possibly have been stupefied by the revelations of Léa. (The revelation that he had found most painful had been that of a tour which Morel had made with Léa, whereas at the time he had assured M. de Charlus that he was studying music in Germany. He had found support for this falsehood in obliging friends in Germany to whom he had sent his letters, to be forwarded from there to M. de Charlus, who, as it happened, was so positive that Morel was there that he had not even looked at the postmark.) But it is time to rejoin the Baron as he advances with Brichot and myself towards the Verdurins’ door     “And what,” he went on, turning to myself, “has become of your young Hebrew friend, whom we met at Douville? It occurred to me that, if you liked, one might perhaps invite him to the house one evening.” For M. de Charlus, who did not shrink from employing a private detective to spy upon every word and action of Morel, for all the world like a husband or a lover, had not ceased to pay attention to other young men. The vigilance which he made one of his old servants maintain, through an agency, upon Morel, was so indiscreet that his footmen thought they were being watched, and one of the housemaids could not endure the suspense, never ventured into the street, always expecting to find a policeman at her heels. “She can do whatever she likes! It would be a waste of time and money to follow her! As if her goings on mattered to us!” the old servant ironically exclaimed, for he was so passionately devoted to his master that, albeit he in no way shared the Baron’s tastes, he had come in time, with such ardour did he employ himself in their service, to speak of them as though they were his own. “He is the very best of good fellows,” M. de Charlus would say of this old servant, for we never appreciate anyone so much as those who combine with other great virtues that of placing themselves unconditionally at the disposal of our vices. It was moreover of men alone that M. de Charlus was capable of feeling any jealousy so far as Morel was concerned. Women inspired in him no jealousy whatever. This is indeed an almost universal rule with the Charlus type. The love of the man with whom they are in love for women is something different, which occurs in another animal species (a lion does not interfere with tigers); does not distress them; if anything, reassures them. Sometimes, it is true, in the case of those who exalt their inversion to the level of a priesthood, this love creates disgust. These men resent their friends’ having succumbed to it, not as a betrayal but as a lapse from virtue. A Charlus, of a different variety from the Baron, would have been as indignant at the discovery of Morel’s relations with a woman as upon reading in a newspaper that he, the interpreter of Bach and Handel, was going to play Puccini. It is, by the way, for this reason that the young men who, with an eye to their own personal advantage, condescend to the love of men like Charlus, assure them that women inspire them only with disgust, just as they would tell a doctor that they never touch alcohol, and care only for spring water. But M. de Charlus, in this respect, departed to some extent from the general rule. Since he admired everything about Morel, the latter’s successes with women caused him no annoyance, gave him the same joy as his successes on the platform, or at écarté. “But do you know, my dear fellow, he has women,” he would say, with an air of disclosure, of scandal, possibly of envy, above all of admiration. “He is extraordinary,” he would continue. “Everywhere, the most famous whores can look at nobody but him. They stare at him everywhere, whether, it’s on the underground or in the theatre. It’s becoming a nuisance! I can’t go out with him to a restaurant without the waiter bringing him notes from at least three women. And always pretty women too. Not that there’s anything surprising in that. I was watching him yesterday, I can quite understand it, he has become so beautiful, he looks just like a Bronzino, he is really marvellous.” But M. de Charlus liked to shew that he was in love with Morel, to persuade other people, possibly to persuade himself, that Morel was in love with him. He applied to the purpose of having Morel always with him (notwithstanding the harm that the young fellow might do to the Baron’s social position) a sort of self-esteem. For (and this is frequent among men of good position, who are snobs, and, in their vanity, sever all their social ties in order to be seen everywhere with a mistress, a person of doubtful or a lady of tarnished reputation, whom nobody will invite, and with whom nevertheless it seems to them flattering to be associated) he had arrived at that stage at which self-esteem devotes all its energy to destroying the goals to which it has attained, whether because, under the influence of love, a man finds a prestige which he is alone in perceiving in ostentatious relations with the beloved object, or because, by the waning of social ambitions that have been gratified, and the rising of a tide of subsidiary curiosities all the more absorbing the more platonic they are, the latter have not only reached but have passed the level at which the former found it difficult to remain    As for young men in general, M. de Charlus found that to his fondness for them Morel’s existence was not an obstacle, and that indeed his brilliant reputation as a violinist or his growing fame as a composer and journalist might in certain instances prove an attraction. Did anyone introduce to the Baron a young composer of an agreeable type, it was in Morel’s talents that he sought an opportunity of doing the stranger a favour. “You must,” he would tell him, “bring me some of your work so that Morel can play it at a concert or on tour. There is hardly any decent music written, now, for the violin. It is a godsend to find anything new. And abroad they appreciate that sort of thing enormously. Even in the provinces there are little musical societies where they love music with a fervour and intelligence that are quite admirable.” Without any greater sincerity (for all this could serve only as a bait and it was seldom that Morel condescended to fulfil these promises), Bloch having confessed that he was something of a poet (when he was ‘in the mood,’ he had added with the sarcastic laugh with which he would accompany a platitude, when he could think of nothing original), M. de Charlus said to me: “You must tell your young Israelite, since he writes verses, that he must really bring me some for Morel. For a composer, that is always the stumbling block, to find something decent to set to music. One might even consider a libretto. It would not be without interest, and would acquire a certain value from the distinction of the poet, from my patronage, from a whole chain of auxiliary circumstances, among which Morel’s talent would take the chief place, for he is composing a lot just now, and writing too, and very pleasantly, I must talk to you about it. As for his talent as a performer (there, as you know, he is already a past-master), you shall see this evening how well the lad plays Vinteuil’s music; he overwhelms me; at his age, to have such an understanding while he is still such a boy, such a kid! Oh, this evening is only to be a little rehearsal. The big affair is to come off in two or three days. But it will be much more distinguished this evening. And so we are delighted that you have come,” he went on, employing the plural pronoun doubtless because a King says: “It is our wish.” “The programme is so magnificent that I have advised Mme. Verdurin to give two parties. One in a few days’ time, at which she will have all her own friends, the other to-night at which the hostess is, to use a legal expression, ‘disseized.’ It is I who have issued the invitations, and I have collected a few people from another sphere, who may be useful to Charlie, and whom it will be nice for the Verdurins to meet. Don’t you agree, it is all very well to have the finest music played by the greatest artists, the effect of the performance remains muffled in cotton-wool, if the audience is composed of the milliner from across the way and the grocer from round the corner. You know what I think of the intellectual level of people in society, still they can play certain quite important parts, among others that which in public events devolves upon the press, and which is that of being an organ of publicity. You know what I mean; I have for instance invited my sister-in-law Oriane; it is not certain that she will come, but it is on the other hand certain that, if she does come, she will understand absolutely nothing. But one does not ask her to understand, which is beyond her capacity, but to talk, a task which is admirably suited to her, and which she never fails to perform. What is the result? To-morrow as ever is, instead of the silence of the milliner and the grocer, an animated conversation at the Mortemarts’ with Oriane telling everyone that she has heard the most marvellous music, that a certain Morel, and so forth; unspeakable rage of the people not invited, who will say: ‘Palamède thought, no doubt, that we were unworthy; anyhow, who are these people who were giving the party?’ a counterblast quite as useful as Oriane’s praises, because Morel’s name keeps cropping up all the time and is finally engraved in the memory like a lesson that one has read over a dozen times. All this forms a chain of circumstances which may be of value to the artist, to the hostess, may serve as a sort of megaphone for a performance which will thus be made audible to a remote public. Really, it is worth the trouble; you shall see what progress Charlie has made. And what is more, we have discovered a new talent in him, my dear fellow, he writes like an angel. Like an angel, I tell you.” M. de Charlus omitted to say that for some time past he had been employing Morel, like those great noblemen of the seventeenth century who scorned to sign and even to write their own slanderous attacks, to compose certain vilely calumnious little paragraphs at the expense of Comtesse Mole. Their insolence apparent even to those who merely glanced at them, how much more cruel were they to the young woman herself, who found in them, so skilfully introduced that nobody but herself saw the point, certain passages from her own correspondence, textually quoted, but interpreted in a sense which made them as deadly as the cruellest revenge. They killed the lady. But there is edited every day in Paris, Balzac would tell us, a sort of spoken newspaper, more terrible than its printed rivals. We shall see later on that this verbal press reduced to nothing the power of a Charlus who had fallen out of fashion, and exalted far above him a Morel who was not worth the millionth part of his former patron. Is this intellectual fashion really so simple, and does it sincerely believe in the nullity of a Charlus of genius, in the incontestable authority of a crass Morel? The Baron was not so innocent in his implacable vengeance. Whence, no doubt, that bitter venom on his tongue, the spreading of which seemed to dye his cheeks with jaundice when he was in a rage. “You who knew Bergotte,” M. de Charlus went on, “I thought at one time that you might, perhaps, by refreshing his memory with regard to the youngster’s writings, collaborate in short with myself, help me to assist a twofold talent, that of a musician and a writer, which may one day acquire the prestige of that of Berlioz. As you know, the Illustrious have often other things to think about, they are smothered in flattery, they take little interest except in themselves. But Bergotte, who was genuinely unpretentious and obliging, promised me that he would get into the Gaulois, or some such paper, those little articles, a blend of the humourist and the musician, which he really does quite charmingly now, and I am really very glad that Charlie should combine with his violin this little stroke of Ingres’s pen. I know that I am prone to exaggeration, when he is concerned, like all the old fairy godmothers of the Conservatoire. What, my dear fellow, didn’t you know that? You have never observed my little weakness. I pace up and down for hours on end outside the examination hall. I’m as happy as a queen. As for Char"

The car pulls into the park, where the sign reads ""Storytown Village: Fun for Ages 1 to 7 1/2."" Bart, Lisa and Homer groan loudly. The Family arrive at a ""Three Little Pigs"" exhibit, where they prepare to watch a shoddy animatronic Wolf blow in the house of three pigs. THE WOLF Come out, come out, or I'll blooow your house in. THE THREE PIGS Not by the hairs on our chinny-chin-chin. BART What a load of crappy-crap-crap. HOMER Quiet, boy. I have a feeling some bad stuff is about to go down. MARGE This is where the wolf blows down the pigs' house. BART He blows, all right. He blows big time. MARGE That's it, honey! Get into the spirit! The wolf slowly leans back with a raspy inward breath, then leans forward and weakly ""blows"" at the house. On a metallic  lever, the house is tilted upwards and back barely a foot. Maggie claps furiously while the other onlookers are unimpressed. HOMER Ah it was good, but not great. Cut to the family viewing an exhibition of Goldilocks and the Three Bears, with similarly crappy animatronic characters. Tinkly music can be heard. FATHER BEAR (standing next to an empty unmade bed) Somebody's been sleeping in my bed. MOTHER BEAR (highly distorted) Somebody's been sleeping in my bed. YOUNG BEAR (standing next to a bed, under whose sheets there is clearly somebody sleeping) Somebody's been sleeping in my bed. Grandpa emerges, angry, from the sheets. GRANDPA Well I'm sorry, but it was a hundred and fifty degrees in the car. Bart visits a ride called ""Tottertown Trolley"". At the unattended entrance is a cut-out green cartoon elf, holding his arm out level and with a speech bubble that reads, ""You must be shorter than this to ride."" Bart looks around mischievously and proceeds to limbo his way through. BART (limboing) La la la la la la la la, la la la la la la la la. Bart jumps onto the first seat of a tiny red train—the children directly behind him are half his size. As the train sets off, Bart faces behind him and chuckles. BART Hahaha. So long, suckers! Just as he finishes and turns to face the front, his head smashes into the top of a tunnel. The train continues, but the tunnel is now being dragged along with it by nothing more than Bart's head. Bart, however, places his hands on it for some support while it races through the track, uprooting artificial trees. The train comes to a halt when it passes underneath the legs of a wooden lumberjack, whose crotch is met by Bart's face. The top half of the lumberjack splits off at the waist, and he falls to the floor—on the way down, his axe cleanly decapitates an artificial duck wearing a bonnet and glasses and carrying a book. The other kids on the ride cheer loudly. We are at ""Little Bo Peep's Petting Zoo."" Homer is seen confronting a goat with an empty tin can. HOMER Come on! Eat the can! Come on! MARGE You're supposed to feed them pellets from the machine over there. Marge goes over to the pellet machine. She inserts a coin and twists its release—causing the entire contents the spill out and cover Maggie in pellets. The nearby animals notice and crowd around Maggie. Once they disperse, all the pellets have been eaten and the only thing left of Maggie is her pacifier, which spins on the ground. MARGE Oh my. Marge looks around at several animals, then notices a Llama scratch at its side. Maggie falls out of its thick fur. Marge runs over and picks up her daughter. The family check out three lambs, each one cuter than the last. The family observe the first lamb. WHOLE FAMILY Awww! They see the second: smaller, cuter, and wearing a tiny cowbell around its neck. WHOLE FAMILY(louder) Awww! They see the third: tinier still, with big fluttery eyes and a large pink bow around its neck. WHOLE FAMILY (louder still) Awww! The first lamb walks into view. Homer smacks it aside. HOMER Out of the way, you. (leaning back and folding his arms) Awww. Lisa pets the smallest lamb while it appears to eat from her hand. LISA Oh, you are so cute! yes you are, you are, I just love you! Marge appears, chuckling MARGE See? It was a good idea to come here after all. A gruff female voice—similar to lunchlady Doris's—plays over a P.A. system. P.A. VOICE Attention: this is Mother Goose. The following cars have been broken into. We see the orange sedan pull into the Simpsons' driveway, its back window clearly smashed through. The family climbs out of the car and sounds of revelry can be heard from next door. HOMER Hmm? Homer walks round to Flanders's backyard. A large painted sign reads, ""Flanders Family Reunion, B.B.Q."" A large number of people are gathered, all similar in appearance and dress to Ned Flanders. Several people are up on a temporary stage playing a fiddle, guitar and a banjolin, while many other attendees are dancing. FLANDERS  Swing your partner to and froodily-fro! everybody else claps in time to the music, while Homer grows slightly angry. The music stops. HOMER Hey, Flanders. ALL THE FLANDERESES Hi-de-li-ho, neighborino! HOMER Shut up! ALL THE FLANDERESES Okely dokely! HOMER Ned! You're having a family reunion and you didn't invite me? FLANDERS Oh, gosh, Homer, this is strictly a Flanders affair. I've got family here from around the globe. Here's José Flanders. JOSÉ FLANDERS Buenos ding-dong-diddly-dias, señor. FLANDERS And this is Lord Thistlethwaite Flanders. LORD THISTLETHWAITE Charmed. Ned nudges him. Er. A-googely-doogley. FLANDERS Heh-heh-heh. HOMER I can't believe you didn't invite me. (narrows eyes) After I painted those cool stripes all over your car. He clicks his fingers. I know! I'll throw my own barbecue. The greatest barbecue this town has ever seen. And I'll only invite who I want. That'll show ya! FLANDERS Can I come? HOMER Sure. D'oh! The Simpson family are sitting at the dinner table. HOMER This barbecue will be hard, thankless work. But I'm sure you're up to it, Marge. MARGE Well, it could be a good chance to get to know our neighbors outside of a courtoom setting. HOMER You know what you should serve, Marge? More of these lamb chops. These are the best ever. MARGE Why thank you, Homie. You might say, the extra ingredient is salt. The family eat dinner, chewing loudly. Maggie sucks on a whole lamb chop in lieu of her pacifier. Lisa prepares to cut into her meat, but hesitates. She imagines the lamb from earlier floating above her meal, this time with two chop-sized holes; the cuts of meat float up off her plate and insert themsevles into these holes. LAMB Please, Lisa. I thought you lo-o-o-ved me. Lo-o-o-ved me-e-e! Lisa gasps. Marge appears, adding more chops to Lisa's plate MARGE What's wrong, Lisa? Didn't you get enough lamb chops? LISA (pushing away her plate) I can't eat this. I can't eat a poor little lamb. HOMER Lisa, get ahold of yourself. This is lamb, not a lamb. LISA What's the difference between this lamb and the one that kissed me? BART (holding up his lamb chop) This one's spent two hours in the broiler. He bites down in the middle of the chop. MARGE Bart, sensible bites! All right Lisa, if you don't want lamb chops there are lots of other things I can make. Chicken breast. Lisa imagines a live chicken, out of which falls a cooked breast onto a plate. Rump roast? Lisa imagines a cow in the same way, whose rump falls off and lands on a plate. Hot dogs?  Lisa imagines a hot dog bun surrounded by a rat, a raccoon, a boot and a pigeon. She imagines parts of these all coming together in the middle to form a hot dog: the rat's tail, the raccoon's feet, the boot's tongue, and the pigeon's head. The thought-cloud disperses with a loud puff. LISA No, I can't! I can't eat any of them! HOMER Wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute. Lisa, honey: are you saying you're never going to eat any animal again? What about bacon? LISA No. HOMER Ham? LISA No! HOMER (flabbergasted) Pork chop? LISA Dad, those all come from the same animal. Homer chuckles. HOMER Oh, yeah, right Lisa. A wonderful, magical animal. Heh-heh-heh. BART I think Lisa's right, dad. He waves a pork chop at Lisa. Eating meat is ba-a-a-d. Lisa slaps the chop out of Bart's hand, and it lands in Homer's mouth. BART Hey, that's my chop! Bart places his teeth around the other end, and the two fight over it, growling and barking. Act Two. A shot of the Springfield Elementary building. Cut to Lisa in class, sitting next to a gum-chewing Janey. LISA Oh, my family just doesn't understand my new-found vegetarianism.  Janey blows a bubble while looking silently at Lisa. It bursts. Compared to them, the public schools are a haven of enlightenment. MISS HOOVER OK class, time to dissect our worms. Every student except Lisa cheers loudly. Miss Hoover passes round the trays with worms. Lisa looks at hers with apprehension. MISS HOOVER First, pin them down so they don't fly up and hit you in the eye. RALPH Um, Miss Hoover? MISS HOOVER Yes, Ralph, what is it. RALPH My worm went in my mouth and then I ate it, can I have a new one? MISS HOOVER No Ralph, there aren't any more.  Sighs. Just try to sleep while the other children are learning. RALPH Oh boy, sleep! That's where I'm a viking! Lisa looks sadly down at her worm. WORM (in a lamb's voice) Lisa, what did I ever do to you? LISA (aloud) Why does it talk like a lamb? She picks up her scalpel and hesitates over the worm, finally pushing away the tray realizing she can't do it. LISA Uh, miss Hoover? I don't think I can dissect an animal. I think it's wrong. MISS HOOVER (calmly) OK, Lisa. I respect your moral objection. She surreptitiously moves a hand under her desk, where there is a red button with a sign that reads, ""Independent Thought Alarm."" She presses it. We are in the cafeteria. The camera scrolls through what's on offer for lunch: Giblet McNiblets, Salisbury Balls, Cow Legs. LISA Um, excuse me: isn't there anything here that doesn't have meat in it? LUNCHLADY DORIS Possibly the meatloaf. LISA Well, I believe you're required to provide a vegetarian alternative. Lunchlady Doris picks up a hot dog, slips the dog out of its bun, and drops the bun on Lisa's tray. LUNCHLADY DORIS Yum. It's rich in bunly goodness. LISA (sardonically) Do you remember when you lost your passion for this work? Lunchlady Doris takes her cigarette out of her mouth, and looks shiftily side to side. She reaches down and presses her own Independent Thought Alarm. Cut to Skinner's office, where a red lightbulb flashes and a brief noise is heard. SKINNER (turning round in his chair) Uh-oh. Two independent thought alarms in one day. The students are over-stimulated. Willie, remove all the colored chalk from the classrooms. GROUNDSKEEPER WILLIE I warned ya! Didn't I warn ya! That colored chalk was forged by Lucifer himself! Bart and Lisa are watching The Itchy and Scratchy Show back at home, an episode entitled ""In Espohagus Now."" On the show, Itchy visits a restaurant run by Itchy. After Scratchy chooses the steak, itchy creeps under the tablecloth, shaves Scratchy's belly fur, drags the belly onto a plate, pops an olive into the belly button, sticks a sign reading ""Rare"" into it, and emerges to serve Scratchy with his own belly. Scratchy cuts out a triangular piece and eats it, only to have it instantly pop back out of the hole from which it was cut. This happens several times. Itchy then arrives, places the piece of belly in a takeout container, and hands over a bill for $100.00. Scratchy's eyes pop out and his head blows off. Bart laughs heartily while Lisa looks disheartened. LISA I never realized before, but some Itchy & Scratchy cartoons send the message that violence against animals is funny. BART (standing up) Say what? Cartoons don't have messages, Lisa. They're just a bunch of hilarious stuff, you know, like people getting hurt and stuff, stuff like that. Homer bursts into the living-room and the door smashes into Bart. HOMER Look, kids! I just got my party invitations back from the printer's! He hands one to Lisa. LISA (reading aloud) Come to Homer's B.B.B.Q. The extra ""B"" is for BYOBB. BART (pointing at the invitation) What's that extra ""B"" for? HOMER (slightly annoyed) That's a typo. LISA Dad, can't you have some other kid of party, one where you don't serve meat? HOMER All normal people love meat. If I went to a barbecue and there was no meat, I would say, ""Yo Goober! Where's the meat?"" I'm trying to impress people here, Lisa. You don't win friends with salad. BART (sing-song)You don't win friends with salad! You don't win friends with salad!  Homer joins in. BART AND HOMER You don't win friends with salad! You don't win friends with salad! You don't win friends with salad! You don't win friends with salad! You don't win friends with salad! You don't win friends with salad! You don't win friends with salad! You don't win friends with salad! Marge has joined in. BART, HOMER, MARGE You don't win friends with salad! You don't win friends with salad! You don't win friends with salad! You don't win friends with salad! You don't win friends with salad! You don't win friends with salad! LISA Mom! MARGE I didn't mean to take sides, I just got caught up in the rhythm. Cut to Lisa's classroom. Skinner is addressing the students. SKINNER Good morning, class. A certain—agitator—for privacy's sake let's call her ""Lisa S."" No, that's too obvious. Let's say ""L. Simpson."" Lisa palms her forehead while other students turn to look at her. Has raised questions about certain school policies. So. In the interests of creating an open dialogue, sit silently and watch this film. The film's titles appear: ""The Meat Council Presents: 'Meat and You: Partners in Freedom'. Number 3F03 in the 'Resistance is Useless' Series."" troy McClure walks onscreen dressed as a cowboy. MCCLURE Nothing beats a stroll in cattle country. The shot widens and we see that he has been waking on top of a packed enclosure of cows. he steps down onto the grass. Hi, I'm Troy McClure. You might remember me from such educational films as Two Minus Three Equals Negative Fun, and Firecrackers: The Silent Killer. A young boy's voice is heard offscreen. JIMMY Mr McClure? McClure walks over to Bobby, who is sitting at a school desk on which sits a plate with a large steak. MCCLURE Oh, hello Bobby. JIMMY Jimmy. I'm curious as to how meat gets from the ranch to my stomach. MCCLURE Whoah, whoah, whoah, slow down Jimmy. You just asked a mouthful. The Camera pans over many cows tightly enclosed within wooden fences. It all starts here in the high-density feedline. The when he cattle are just right—he runs a finger across a cow's back, puts it in his mouth an murmurs appreciatively—it's time for them to ""graduate"" from Bovine University. The Cows begin to be sent along a conveyor belt, into the slaughterhouse. MCLLURE Come on Jimmy, let's take a look at the killing floor. Jimmy gasps. Don't let the name throw you, Jimmy: it's not really a floor. it's more of a steel grating that allows material to sluice through so that it can be collected and exported. The camera pans past the slaughterhouse, while the sound of electrified killing equipment can be heard, as well as the muffled screams of cows. At the end of the building, a conveyor belt carries out cuts of meat, which all drop into the back of a truck labelled, ""Meat for You."" Filled, the truck pulls away. McClure and Jimmy exit via  door. Jimmy i pale and visibly shaking. MCCLURE Hungry, Jimmy? JIMMY Er. (holding his hands across his stomach) Mr McClure, I have a crazy friend who says it's wrong to eat meat. Is he crazy? MCCLURE (tapping his finger to his temple) No, just ignorant. You se, your crazy friend never heard of (looks to camera) the food chain. A picture labelled ""The Food Chain"" appears. A silhouette of a human is surrounded by silhouettes of various creatures (including monkeys, alligators and snails) with arrows point from them to the human. Just ask this Scientician. The camera shows a spectacled scientist look up from a microscope. SCIENTICIAN Uhh— MCCLURE He'll tell you, that in nature invariably eats another to survive. A series of short clips. A lion chases and catches a gazelle; an eagle flies over a flock of sheep, snatching one in its talons and flying off; a dog jumps and catches a frisbee; a gorilla, hanging off a tree to reach for a bunch of bananas, is suddenly pulled into the surrounding water by a shark that jumps out of it. McClure, kneeling, addresses Jimmy. MCCLURE Don't kid yourself, Jimmy. If a cow ever got the chance he'd eat you and everyone you care about. A cow is seen grazing on a field. The camera zooms in on his face while a short piece of dramatic music can be heard. JIMMY Wow, Mr McClure. i was a grade-A moron to ever question eating meat. MCCLURE Ha ha ha ha. Yes you were, Jimmy. Yes you were. He ruffles Jimmy's hair. JIMMY Ah—you're hurting me. The words ""The End"" are branded into a cow's backside. LISA They can't seriously expect us to swallow that tripe. SKINNER Now, as a special treat courtesy of our friends at the meat council, please help yourself to this tripe.  He gestures towards a table on which there is a big tray of tripe and many small plates. LISA Stop it, stop it! Don't you realize you've just been brainwashed by corporate propaganda? JANEY Pfft. Apparently my crazy friend here hasn't heard of the food chain. UNNAMED NERD Yeah, Lisa's a grade-A moron. RALPH (holding a plate of tripe When I grow up, I'm going to Bovine University! The guests mumber uncomprehendingly. It's tomato soup, served ice cold! The guests laugh mockingly. BARNEY Go back to Russia! Lisa walks upstairs to her room and places a pillow over her head. Outside, Dr hibbert eats a hot dog. HIBBERT Ahh. Diagnosis: delicious.  Homer appears with a hot dog on a plate. HOMER I've got the prescription for you, doctor: another hot beef injection. Dr. hibbert chuckles. Wiggum sits at a bench, bloated and short of breath. WIGGUM Hey Homer: wing me another of of them, ah, burgers, would ya? Can't quite seem to stand up under my own power anymore. HOMER (flipping a burger far behind him for Wiggum to catch between a bun) One whopper for the COPPER! BART Another burger, dad? HOMER Here you GO! Homer flips the burger high into the air. Cut to Lisa lying on her bed. LISA It's bad enough they're all eating meat. They don't have to rub it in my face. The Burger flies through Lisa's window and lands squarely on her face. She moans with disgust and sits up. Outside. HOMER OK everybody. It's the moment you've all been waiting for. He wheels over a smoker and removes its lid to reveal a entire roasted pig. The pig de resistance! ALL GUESTS Oooh! Ahhh! Lisa appears, looking furious and riding a lawnmower. She drives into the barbecue, pushing it away. The guests all gasp. MARGE Bart, no! BART What? MARGE Sorry, force of habit. Lisa, no! Lisa crashes through the fence and drives out into the street, still pushing the barbecue in fornt of her. Homer and Bart chase her up a hill, until Lisa reaches the top and lets the barbecue go. It travels quickly away. Homer and Bart chase the pig through a hedge. HOMER It's just a little dirty. It's still good, it's still good! The Pig travels across a busy road, and then drops over a bridge into a river. HOMER It's just a little slimy. It's still good, it's still good! The pig floats along the river and into a drainage hole in a dam. As it plugs the hole, the water pressure builds up until it flies out like a torpedo, traveling a huge distance through the air. HOMER It's just a little airborne. It's still good, it's still good! BART It's gone. HOMER I know. Smithers and burns stand in Burns's office, looking out of his window. BURNS You know Smithers, I think I'll donate a million dollars to the local orphanage. (pauses) When pigs fly! They laugh. The pig flies past the window. They stop laughing. SMITHERS Will you be donating that million dollars now, sir? BURNS Hm, no, I'd still prefer not. ACT THREE Homer looks through a pair of binoculars to try to locate the pig. No luck. BART Give it up, dad. Piggie ain't coming back. Homer throws the binoculars into the trash. HOMER Lisa, you ruined my barbecue! I demand you apologize this second. LISA I'm never ever apologizing, because I was standing up for a just cause, and you were wrong, wrong, wrong! now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to my room. HOMER That's it! Go to your room! The family are eating breakfast. HOMER Marge, since I'm not talking to Lisa, would you please ask her to pass me the syrup? MARGE (sighing) Please pass your father the syrup, Lisa. LISA Bart, tell dad I'll only pass the syrup if it won't be used on any meat products. BART You dunkin' your sausages in that syrup, homeboy? HOMER Marge, tell Bart I just want to drink a nice glass of syrup like I do every morning. MARGE Tell him yourself, you're ignoring Lisa, not Bart. HOMER Bart, thank your mother for pointing that out. MARGE Homer, you're not not taking to me, and secondly I heard what you said. HOMER Lisa, tell your mother to get off my case. BART Uh dad, Lisa's the one you're not talking to. HOMER Bart, go to your room! LISA (viciously)Why don't you just eat him, dad? HOMER I don't need any serving suggestions from you, you barbecue-wrecking know-nothing know-it-all! LISA That's it! I can't live in a house with this prehistoric carnivore! I am out of here! Lisa gets up and leaves the house by the front door. HOMER That's it! Go to your room! Outside, Lisa wanders over to Sherri, Terri, Janey and Ralph, who are playing by a hopscotch court. SHERRI Look, it's Mrs potato head! TERRI She has a head made out of lettuce. The twins giggle. RALPH (sitting up on a tree branch)I can't believe I used to go out with you. JANEY Are you gonna marry a carrot, Lisa? LISA (sighing, sarcastic) Yes, I'm gonna marry a carrot. The other children gasp and laugh. JANEY She admitted it! She admitted it, she's gonna marry a carrot! Lisa walks off. She arrives t a Krusty Burger and looks at a sign in the window that reads, ""Try our new beef-flavored chicken!"" She walks away and looks up at a bilboard showing a female doctor next to the legend, ""Don't eat beef."" Lisa perks and and smiles. The billboard shifts to read, ""Eat deer."" Lisa goes back to being sad. She cycles through some memories of meat: Chief Wiggum eating a burger, Bart and Homer fighting over the lamb chop, Marge cheerfully chopping something unseen with a meat-cleaver and being covered in blood, Kent Brockman saying ""... Your windows"" and taking a bit out of a chicken drumstick. Overwhelmed, Lisa wanders to the Kwik-E-Mart window displaying hot dogs under a sign: ""Premiere Gourmet Hot Dogs 8/99 ¢."" LISA The whole world wants me to eat meat. I can't fight it anymore!She walks in, places a hot dog in a bun and, after some hesitation, takes a bite. She leans back with her arms in the air. There! Is everybody happy now? Apu appears APU I take it from your yelling that you like my tofu-dogs. LISA (surprised) Tofu? APU Oh yes, No meat whatsoever. And only thrice the fat of a normal hot dog. I made the switch, and nobody noticed! LISA But why, Apu? APU Of course I am a vegetarian. Haven't you ever seen my t-shirt? He holds up a t-shirt bearing a picture of a cow in a red circle with a line through it. Around the circle reads the slogan, ""Don't Have a Cow, Man!"" Lisa chuckles. LISA That's cute. APU Here. Let me show you something, Lisa. He leads her over to a fridge marked ""non-alcoholic beer."" He opens it to reveal a set of icy steps. LISA Wow, a secret staircase. but what do you do if somebody wants non-alcoholic beer? APU You know, it's never come up. They go up the stairs out onto a pleasant roof-garden. LISA Oh Apu, it's beautiful. APU Yes, this is where I come when I need some refuge from the modern world. Or, when I want to see drive-in movies for free. He gestures to a drive-in movie theater across the street, which is advertisign two movies: I Spit on Your Grave  and I Thumb Through Your Magazines. I know it is not easy to be a vegetarian, Lisa. LISA That's why I ran away form home. PAUL MCCARTNEY (offscreen) What? She's leaving home? McCartney walks into shot, holding a trowel. LISA Wow, Paul McCartney! I read about you in history class. But where's your wife, Linda? Linda McCartney emerges from a bush. LINDA MCCARTNEY Right here, Lisa. Whenever we're in Springfield, we like to hang out in Apu's garden in the shade. PAUL We met him in India, years ago during the Maharishi days. APU back then, I was known as the fifth Beatle. PAUL Sure you were, Apu. APU You know what, Lisa? Paul and Linda are vegetarians too. In fact, Linda has her own line of vegetarian entrées. LISA Apu, I'm sure the last thing they want to talk about is— LINDA We weren't satisfied with the other vegetarian meals on the market. You'd be surprised how often you'd find a big hunk of pork in them LISA Ew! PAUL Linda and I both feel strongly about animal rights. In fact, if you play ""Maybe I'm Amazed"" backwards, you'll hear a recipe for a really ripping lentil soup. LISA When will all those fools learn that you can be perfectly healthy eating vegetables, fruits, grains and cheese? APU Ooh! Cheese? LISA You don't eat cheese, Apu? APU No I don't eat any food that comes from an animal. LISA Oh, then you must think I'm a monster. APU Yes indeed I do think that. But, I learned long ago, Lisa, to tolerate others rather than forcing my beliefs on them. You know you can influence people without badgering them over it. It's like Paul's song, ""Live and let Live."" PAUL Actually, it was ""Live and Let Die."" APU Whatever, whatever, it had a good rhythm. LISA I guess I have been pretty hard on a lot of people. Especially my dad. Thanks, you guys. PAUL Lisa. before you go, would you like to hear a song? LISA Wow, that'd be great! PAUL OK. Take it, Apu. Apu picks up some bongo drums, and begins playing them while singing a singular version of the beginning of ""Sgt. pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band."" APU I'm Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band! I hope I will enjoy my show! Paul and Linda bop while Lisa backs away. She leaves the Kwik-E-Mart. Down the street, Homer is searching for her. HOMER (looking into a manhole) Lisa? (shouting into a pram) Lisa! The pram is whisked away. Lisa! Come back before everyone finds out what a horrible father I am. LISA (at his elbow) Hi dad. Looking for me? HOMER I dunno. you looking for me? LISA I 'unno. HOMER (downtrodden) Oh. Lisa, I was looking for ya. I wanted to apologize. I don't know exactly what went wrong, but I know it's always my fault. LISA Actually dad, this time, I was wrong. Homer gasps. Too. HOMER Ah. LISA While I was gone, I got some really good advice from Paul and Linda McCartney. HOMER Rockstars. Is there anything they don't know? LISA I still stand by my beliefs. But I can't defend what I did. I'm sorry I messed up your barbecue. HOMER I understand, honey. I used to believe in things when I was a kid. They hug.  Come on, I'll give you a piggyback ride. Uh, oops. I mean a veggieback ride home. Come on. Lisa laughs as she climbs upon her dad's shoulders. They walk down the street. Paul Mccartney's ""Maybe I'm Amazed"" plays over the closing credits. THE END."
