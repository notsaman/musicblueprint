3,The Chainsmokers,Closer,"Hey, I was doing just fine before I met you
I drink too much
And that's an issue, but I'm okay
Hey, you tell your friends
It was nice to meet them
But I hope I never see them again

I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke-down car
And four years, no calls
Now you're lookin' pretty in a hotel bar
And I-I-I can't stop
No, I-I-I can't stop

So, baby, pull me closer
In the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older

We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older

You look as good as the day I met you
I forget just why I left you, I was insane
Stay and play that blink-182 song
That we beat to death in Tucson, okay

I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke-down car
And four years, no call
Now I'm lookin' pretty in a hotel bar
And I-I-I can't stop
No, I-I-I can't stop

So, baby, pull me closer
In the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older

We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older

So, baby, pull me closer
In the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder

But you said you didn't need 'em (Mike WiLL Made-It!)

That girl is a real crowd pleaser (oh yeah)
Small world, all her friends know of me (know me)
Young bull livin' like an old geezer (ah)
Quick release the cash, watch it fall slowly (slowly)
Frat girls still tryna get even (get even)
Haters mad for whatever reason (yeah, yeah)
Smoke in the air, binge drinking (oh, oh)
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle (remember)

Getting so gone I'm not blinkin'
What in the world was I thinkin'?
New day, new money to be made
There is nothin' to explain
I'm a fuckin' black Beatle, cream seats in the Regal
Rockin' John Lennon lenses, like to see ‘em spread eagle
Took a bitch to the club and let her party on the table
Screamin', ""Everybody's famous!""
Like clockwork, I blow it all
And get some more
Get you somebody that can do both
Black Beatles got the babes belly rollin'
She think she love me, I think she trollin'

A yellow bitch with green hair, a real weirdo
Black man, yellow Lamb', red light go
They seen that Guwop and them just came in through the side door
There's so much money on the floor we buyin' school clothes
Why you bring the money machine to the club for?
Pint of lean, pound of weed, and a kilo
I Eurostep past a hater like I'm Rondo
I upgrade your baby mama to a condo
Like Chapo servin' llello to the gringos
Black Beatle, club close when I say so

That girl is a real crowd pleaser

She's a good teaser, and we blowin' reefer
Your body like a work of art, baby
Don't fuck with me, I'll break your heart, baby
D&G on me, I got a lot of flavor
15 hundred on my feet, I'm tryna kill these haters
I had haters when I was broke, I'm rich, I still got haters
I had hoes when I was broke, I'm rich, I'm still a player
I wear leather Gucci jackets like it's still the 80s
I've been blowin' OG Kush, I feel a lil' sedated
I can't worry about a broke nigga or a hater
Black Beatle, bitch, me and Paul McCartney related

That girl is a real crowd pleaser
Small world, all her friends know of me

Ya contract should be shredded
Took my dogs on a private jet from the public housing
I kept it G, yeah, one thousand
Clique star-studded like the Paramount mountain
Everything I do is righteous
Betting on me is the right risk
Even in a fucking crisis
I’m never on some switching sides shit
I switch gears to the night shift
Blacking out 'cause I’m enlightened
God talk to me in silence
But I hear him every time, mane
(Thank you, God, God bless you, thank you so much)

Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back
(You ain’t getting checks)
Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Boy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back
D town LAX, every week I bounce back
If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back

Look, I woke up in beast mode
With my girl, that's beauty and the beast though
Been top 5, these niggas sleep though
Only thing that sold out is the seats though
(Never sold my soul, never will never have)
Nigga how dare you stand before me and not respect my authority
If you fuck with my glory, I'ma drop the L and get gory
I done did everything except worry
Hella drama, my life story
Faith of a mustard seed, I kept growing
I knew that this life was meant for me
Niggas change up more than wishin' wells
Karma come around I'll wish 'em well
Livin' like I’m on a limitless pill
I kill the scene like I’m Denzel
Crazy like my jacket strapped up
Nigga, I don’t act but I'll act up
Brown paper bag like the lunch packed up
Back, back, back, back up
Nigga, I'ma need like 10 feet
Or get stomped out with ten feet
I'ma always lose my temper
You cannot “count to ten” me
If I lose 1, I bounce back like 2, 3 did with 4, 5
Seen courtrooms and court sides, ain’t too many seen both sides
Nigga, fuck what you know
Nigga, I’m takin' back control
The underdog just turned into the wolf and the hunger steady grows
Yeah, I call shots while you call off
Never takin' summer or fall off
When you stay that committed to it, you just fall down and never fall off, so

Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back
(You ain’t getting checks)
Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Boy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back
D town LAX, every week I bounce back
If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back

Bounce back, bounce, bounce
Bounce back, bounce, bounce
Bounce, bounce, bitch, bounce (Yeah)

12,Machine Gun Kelly,Bad Things (with Camila Cabello),"CABELLO KICKED OFF HER SOLO CAREER AND HER BAND SISTERS IN FIFTH HARMONY UNEXPECTEDLY DENOUNCED HER FOR IT. NOW SHE’S GOT A TOP FIVE SINGLE, A MUCH-ANTICIPATED ALBUM COMING AND ZERO SECOND THOUGHTS: “YOU HAVE TO HONOR THAT INNER VOICE”.
CAMILA CABELLO IS LATE FOR BRUNCH. But not sullen, rock-star, hiding-behind-shades late. More like 19-year-old, mixed-up-the-address late. She’s running through the dining room of Versailles, a Cuban restaurant deep in Los Angeles’ San Fernando Valley, lush black hair streaming, apologies pouring forth, having just rushed from the other Versailles, in the city’s center.
As soon as she sits on this mid-January Sunday morning, flashing that disarmingly broad smile, the singer — who was born in Cuba, resides in Miami and is staying in an Airbnb here in town — says, “I’ve got you on what we’re going to eat.” She then proceeds to order, in rapid-fire Spanish, a bounty of food: lemonades, steaks, rice, beans, plantains, croquettes, flan.
Confusion, stress, the promise of a splendid feast: That has pretty much been the story of Cabello’s recent life. It was only a month before this weekend that she was still a member of Fifth Harmony, the most successful girl group since Destiny's Child, with more than 7 million digital songs sold, according to Nielsen Music.
Before the year was out, she was a solo artist weathering accusations from her bandmates (namely, that she quit through her representatives after dodging a series of label interventions and therapy sessions) and even hate-tweets from zealous fans (see: #CamilaIsOverParty).
But that’s the confusion and stress. During that same time, Cabello had plenty to celebrate. The singer, who had collaborated outside of 5H for some time, released the darkly sexy rap-romp single “Bad Things” with Machine Gun Kelly last October, and it climbed the charts. (It’s now No. 1 on the Mainstream Top 40 Chart.) And that’s not even her first hit: “I Know What You Did Last Summer,” her 2015 duet with Shawn Mendes, peaked at No. 20 on the Billboard Hot 100.
She has social numbers to rival the band’s (3.4 million to 5H’s 3.8 million on Twitter and 8.8 million to 8.2 million on Instagram), a guest turn on a Major Lazer song banked and enough studio time booked to successfully capitalize on what seems, in retrospect, like an inevitable transition to solo stardom.
“It would take a big force to stop her from taking over the world,” says her friend Mendes, adding, “She was such a great writing partner. I barely had to speak and she knew exactly what I meant.”
But Cabello, whose album is due this fall, already had fame, fortune and obsessive fans. The true gift, after five years of nonstop touring, recording and meet-and-greets with 5H, is the taste of freedom.
“You know that quote, ‘In the silence, you find God?’ ” asks Cabello, who — in her lace choker, a holey white tee and a black marching band coat — looks like the petite (she’s 5-foot-2) commander of some fun and fashionable army. “I felt like I could hear everything my heart was telling me.”
The heart, of course, can be an unreliable guide, and by going solo Cabello is risking more than the slings and arrows of unhappy Harmonizers. (5H fans — who easily overrun fan polls, like the one for the MTV Video Music Awards’ 2016 Song of the Summer contest, in which “Work From Home” crushed massive songs by Calvin Harris and Drake — are not to be underestimated.)
Only one woman has recently left a girl group for a colossal solo career, and she’s not an ordinary human: She’s Beyoncé.
The closer models for Cabello may be her fellow talent-show contestants in One Direction. But none of their trajectories will quite work for a woman who has to, as it seems all young female pop stars must, thread the wholesome-and-sexy needle.
Zayn Malik disavowed his past, graffitied his home, cloistered himself in a weed cloud and took his sweet time on an album, all of which only made him cooler.
Niall Horan took a backpacking trip, rediscovered the ’70s folk-rock of his youth and launched a career as a troubadour, which just made him dreamier.
Harry Styles is already considered a rock star without having sung a solo note.
Cabello, lest she be judged, must be seductive but pure of heart, strong but vulnerable, self-possessed but not selfish. In a way, girl-group rules still apply.
But that hasn’t stopped her from building on her momentum, and not just by hitting the studio and bringing “Bad Things” to The Ellen DeGeneres Show with Machine Gun Kelly in January (her first post-5H TV appearance, a month after Fifth Harmony’s final televised performance).
She has also carefully cultivated her public voice, telling Lena Dunham in a Lenny interview before Donald Trump’s inauguration: “I’m going to stick up for immigrants, and I’m going to stick up for Hispanic people and their rights.”
After Trump issued his immigration order, she tweeted, “the #MuslimBan is dehumanizing beyond words... im in shock. THIS IS NOT WHO WE ARE.”
“The easiest route would be to shut my mouth, sing the songs, wear the clothes and keep going, you know?” says Cabello with a jittery laugh, weighing life in 5H against going it alone.
“I mean,  at the peak of our career. It’s definitely not the safe option.” But, she says, “I have it in my DNA. The way my mom raised me, it has always been: Don’t settle. Jump and hope you grow wings on the way down.” She flings her arms like she’s on a roller coaster. “I feel alive!”
The lyrics analysis site Genius recently determined that Cabello sang on nearly 45 percent of all the lines in Fifth Harmony’s songs. Even when she was doing the most inside the group, Cabello was doing the most outside it, too. She started writing on her own early in 5H’s career, despite the grueling schedule.
Her friend Taylor Swift’s Red inspired her to make “sonic photographs” of her changing life, so when she wasn’t cutting parts for 5H’s 2013 Better Together EP at Hollywood’s Record Plant, she would be in the studio’s gym, writing lyrics over other artists’ melodies about things like “my first kiss and my first boyfriend.” Then she got GarageBand and a MIDI keyboard, and began churning out “shitty demos” while touring malls and, in time, arenas.
“I would wake up super early,” says Cabello, “get off the bus, go to the hotel, put the TV on super loud — I didn’t want people to hear me f—ing yelling — then go into the bathroom, put my laptop on the toilet and sit on the floor and write all day.”
So she was basically singing into the toilet?
“Yep.”
“She has done her 10,000 hours,” says Cabello’s manager Roger Gold, co-founder of 300 Entertainment. “Fifth Harmony worked incredibly hard 11-and-a-half months of the year. It was an incredible school.”
But when it finally came time for Cabello to go solo, bitter, previously unhinted-at feelings erupted in a shockingly public way.
When I ask her about it, Cabello doesn’t shy away from discussing the drama of late December 2016, although she clearly means to take the high road:
*When did the relationship between you and the group start to change?*
I don’t know. I was always super open  I couldn’t just sing other people’s words and be totally happy with that. You have to follow and honor that inner voice. I always encouraged the girls to do the same.
*Do you feel like that changed the relationship, your asserting that?*
I think that in a group there is always going to be tension, whether it’s because of this thing or  thing. Obviously, I think that rocked the boat.
*Have you been in touch with anyone in 5H since all that went down?*
No.
*Have you reached out directly?*
I did, yeah. I don’t want to get into the details of that, because it was really intense and it’s hard for me to talk about. It makes me sad.
*When I first heard you were going solo, I was like, “I’m sure there are no hard feelings because this isn’t a surprise.” Then I was like, “What’s happening?”*
I had the same reaction. I hoped that it would be a peaceful turning of the page and we would root for each other. But I only got love for them.
Cabello took her first vacation in five years on Christmas, after her mother, Sinuhe, insisted she unplug with the family (including her dad, Alejandro, and 9-year-old sister, Sofia) for three weeks in Cancún.
“The first four days were trippy,” says Cabello. “I was stressing about not stressing about something. Sometimes you’re afraid of the quiet. Like, go, go, go!”
Cabello was raised in Havana and, later, Mexico City. When she was 6, her folks told her they were going to Disney World. Instead, Camila and Sinu (as she’s called) emigrated legally from Mexico, spent a day in holding, took a 36-hour bus ride to Miami and moved in with a friend.
Alejandro was forced to stay behind, but after a year-and-a-half of heartache, he got fed up and took the risk of crossing over. Sinu was an architect in Cuba but found work at a Marshalls, stocking shoes. Alejandro, when he arrived, washed cars at the mall. Today, they have a successful contracting company.
“My parents worked really hard,” says Cabello. “We always had periods where my dad would be out of a job. It was a constant flow of having money, losing everything and then finding a way to get it again. If we had food to eat, a roof over our heads and I was going to school, that was enough.”
(Alejandro finally got his visa in 2016, and Cabello sent her parents to Jamaica on the honeymoon they had never had.)
Cabello’s Florida friends, who all predate her appearance on The X Factor, reconnected for “Friendsgiving” in 2016 and FaceTimed an eighth-grade theater teacher who encouraged Cabello when she first got into acting and singing.
She’s not much for going out: “I had a phase in Miami where I was like, ‘I’m going to do all the things I would do if I were 19,’ ” which she is. “I went , and I was like, ‘I don’t love this.’ ”
After our brunch in Los Angeles, she plans to meet Troye Sivan for coffee and then have him and Swift over to her Silver Lake Airbnb for some “chill stuff.”
Mainly, Cabello’s focused on making music.
Even her hobbies serve the cause. For song ideas she mines poetry (the book Milk and Honey, by young feminist Rupi Kaur, made her cry), novels (currently: Love in the Time of Cholera by Gabriel García Márquez), movies (her favorites include The Notebook, Titanic, Romeo + Juliet and, above all, the 2001 rom-com Serendipity) and inspirational quotes she finds on Tumblr.
She also enjoys practicing guitar — 5H player and “super close friend” Ashlee Juno gave her daily lessons on the group’s 7/27 Tour in 2016.
Romantically speaking, says Cabello, “I don’t have anything going on right now,” although she does let slip that “literally every boy I’ve liked has been a Scorpio.” (Rumormongers, take note: Mendes is a Leo.)
And when we start talking about La La Land, she winds up telling an unbelievable story:
“I love the movie because I’m such a hopeless romantic. It made me feel like I could meet anybody anywhere. Like, yesterday I asked my Uber driver for his number. Because we were actually talking about the movie and he was like, ‘I just came out of a relationship.’ He just sounded like he was a hopeless romantic. And I was like, ‘You know what? I’ll get his number.’ He never texted me back.” What? “I don’t know. Maybe it didn’t go through.”
A few weeks after our brunch, in early February, Cabello’s in the booth at Sphere Studios in Los Angeles, laptop out and Notes app open, singing from a file called “It’s Only Natural” using her achiest coo and a slight patois: “It’s only natural, I need some love from you/I might pull up on you/It’s only human to, wanna do da tings we do.” The vocal is balmy and bright over steel drums and Jack Ü-style edited vocal samples.
“I never underestimated her talent, but I was not expecting her to have such a powerful vision,” says Andrew “Pop” Wansel, who’s known for his work with Kehlani and Alessia Cara, from the control room.
“It’s a real collaboration,” chimes in co-producer Frank Dukes, who has worked with Drake and Travis Scott. “Sometimes it’s like a band just jamming.”
The trio has been honing a handful of songs that skillfully blend Cabello’s love for Rihanna’s ANTI (“I can loop it forever,” she says), the era of R&B-pop that includes Alicia Keys’ 2007 song “No One,” all things Shakira and, of course, Cuban music.
They want to open the LP with a dusty, piano-clanging cut called “Havana” and preview an upbeat Caribbean heater that sounds like Sia planting a flag in “One Dance.”
“Camila is an incredible songwriter,” says Epic Records chairman/CEO Antonio “L.A.” Reid, who (with Simon Cowell) assembled 5H for The X Factor and still has Cabello on his roster. “She is working overtime.”
Cabello’s mom pops into the studio to remind her she has a call in 15 minutes. Sinu isn’t a momager so much as her daughter’s right hand and confidante.
Along with the other members of 5H, she has been by Cabello’s side the entire time, and now she’s the only one left who has seen it all. Fifth Harmony, meanwhile, is soldiering on without Cabello.
Epic plans to release an album from the group in 2017, too, and 5H’s People’s Choice Awards performance of “Work From Home” in January was an unmistakable shoulder-brush, as Fifth Harmony changed the “I” to “We” in Cabello’s opening line, “I ain’t worried about nothing,” and punctuated it with a full stop.
“I know people will try and turn this into, ‘Is she going to be more successful outside the group?’ If I’m growing as an artist, that’s success.”
In April 2016, I interviewed the members of Fifth Harmony for a Billboard cover story, and the chat quickly turned into a tear-drenched airing of grievances about the group’s toll on their private lives. The only one who didn’t cry was Cabello.
“I was like, ‘Oh, my God, this is the saddest thing I’ve ever seen.’ I’m sorry about that,” she tells me this time around.
Cabello wasn’t immune to the pressures, just on the mend, fighting anxiety with journaling, exercise, meditation and music. I remind her what she told me then — that she had recently been afraid of the things her brain might tell her.
“It’s so hard to hear that,” says Cabello, lowering her head. “It breaks my heart. It’s like I’m watching myself from another person’s perspective, like, ‘Damn, poor girl.’ ”
She did finally cry after the turmoil with the group, in Miami with her parents and sister. And then, she says, “I went to the beach a lot. I listened only to Latin music. It reminds me of where I come from and that this  doesn’t have to be World War III. In Cuba, people are literally making rafts out of tires and sticks, throwing themselves into the ocean to find opportunity. That’s real shit. Not this.
“I know people will try and turn this into, ‘Is she going to be more successful outside the group?’ ” continues Cabello. “To me, if I’m in the studio every day and I’m growing as an artist and I’m speaking from my heart, that’s success. The results don’t matter. I mean, isn’t that the goal?”
If Cabello is anxious now, it doesn’t show. She seems proud of what 5H was — “We represented all different kinds of women coming together,” she says fondly — but is candid about what it wasn’t:
“We didn’t write our records. We were interpreting somebody else’s story. Fifth Harmony is an entity or identity outside all of us, and I don’t think anybody felt individually represented by the sound — we didn’t make it.”"

She said, ""You need a job"", bitch, fuck a job, I still get cheese

Sometimes you worry 'bout the things he can provide for ya
Whenever you around I seem to come alive for ya
I finally recognize the feelings that's inside for ya
Although I know your man and trust me he would die for ya
These quiet thoughts of you been going on for years now
I saw you in the party, soft lips, soft spoken
I came and talked to you but homie interfered now
He introduced you as his girl and I was heartbroken
Some people talk about that love at first sight shit
To keep it real I don't know whether I believe it's true
But if it is then tell me if I'm wrong or right
If I fell in love with you before I ever even knew
I catch your eye then look away as if it never happened
At times I feel as though I'm caught up in a strange dream
If eyes could talk then mines would tell ya that I'm feeling you
Sometimes I swear your eyes be telling me the same thing

Put yo motherfuckin' hood up, it's the weekend
Drop that, back that ass up and bitches get to freaking
Last call at the bar, ladies get a drink, nigga get some balls
Ain't no telling you gonna see that bitch tomorrow
Stop holding up the wall waiting for the right song
Better holla cause you know they bout to cut the lights on

And put my number in it—
I'm staring at you from afar, I'm wondering 'bout you
Like, where you from and who you are?
'Cause you a star—no, not the type that snort the white lines
I mean the type to light the night time, I heard you got a man
But who in their right mind letting you out the house alone?
Tell me is your house a home?
Why you in the club looking like you out your zone?
Now be discreet and pull out your phone and put my number in it
Text a nigga when your man leave you unattended
On a scale from 1 to 10 that girl's a hundred and I want it
No question, I know destiny well
And though I sin the Lord blessing me still
Every saint got a past, every sinner got a future
Every loser gotta win and every winner gotta lose someday
They say it's just a matter of time
And if I had my way then you would be mine

25,Shawn Mendes,Treat You Better,"I won't lie to you
I know he's just not right for you
And you can tell me if I'm off
But I see it on your face
When you say that he's the one that you want
And you're spending all your time
In this wrong situation
And anytime you want it to stop

I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me why are we wasting time
On all your wasted crying
When you should be with me instead
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can

I'll stop time for you
The second you say you'd like me too
I just wanna give you the loving that you're missing
Baby, just to wake up with you
Would be everything I need and this could be so different
Tell me what you want to do

'Cause I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me why are we wasting time
On all your wasted crying
When you should be with me instead
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can
Better than he can

Give me a sign
Take my hand, we'll be fine
Promise I won't let you down
Just know that you don't
Have to do this alone
Promise I'll never let you down

'Cause I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me why are we wasting time
On all your wasted crying
When you should be with me instead
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can
Better than he can
Better than he can"
26,Martin Garrix,In the Name of Love,"If I told you this was only gonna hurt
If I warned you that the fire's gonna burn
Would you walk in? Would you let me do it first?
Do it all in the name of love
Would you let me lead you even when you're blind?
In the darkness, in the middle of the night
In the silence, when there's no one by your side
Would you call in the name of love?

In the name of love, name of love
In the name of love, name of love

In the name of
Love
In the name, name
Love
In the name, name
Love

If I told you we could bathe in all the lights
Would you rise up, come and meet me in the sky?
Would you trust me when you're jumping from the heights?
Would you fall in the name of love?
When there's madness, when there's poison in your head
When the sadness leaves you broken in your bed
I will hold you in the depths of your despair
And it's all in the name of love

In the name of love, name of love
In the name of love, name of love

In the name of
Love
In the name, name
Love
In the name, name

I wanna testify
Scream in the holy light
You bring me back to life
And it's all in the name of love
I wanna testify
Scream in the holy light
You bring me back to life

I was enough

We drank too much
I held your hair back when
You were throwing up

Then you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute, I was stone cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said, I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest

I knew I loved you then
But you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool
When I was scared of letting go
I knew I needed you
But I never showed
But I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I'll wake you up with some breakfast in bed
I'll bring you coffee
With a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school
Wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night

When you looked over your shoulder
For a minute, I forget that I'm older
I wanna dance with you right now, oh
And you look as beautiful as ever
And I swear that everyday you'll get better
You make me feel this way somehow

I'm so in love with you
And I hope you know
Darling your love is more
Than worth its weight in gold
We've come so far my dear
Look how we've grown
And I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I wanna live with you
Even when we're ghosts
'Cause you were always there for me
When I needed you most

I'm gonna love you till
My lungs give out
I promise 'til death we part
Like in our vows
So I wrote this song for you
Now everybody knows
That it's just you and me
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

Just say you won't let go
Oh, just say you won't let go"

Are we fading lovers?
We keep wasting colors
Maybe we should let this go

We're falling apart, still we hold together
We've passed the end, so we chase forever
'Cause this is all we know
This feeling's all we know

I'll ride my bike up to the road
Down the streets right through the city
I'll go everywhere you go
From Chicago to the coast
You tell me, ""Hit this and let's go
Blow the smoke right through the window""
'Cause this is all we know

'Cause this is all we know
'Cause this is all we know

Never face each other
One bed, different covers
We don't care anymore
Two hearts still beating
On with different rhythms

We've passed the end, so we chase forever

Dostum, sikeyim
Sorun ne Kyle?
Dostum, bu çocuklar, boş boş konuşup sinirimi bozuyorlar
Aga, sikeyim o çocukları, hayatına bak aga, etrafına bak
Dostum.. Haklısın
Hmm, şuradaki sağlam orospuları görüyor musun?
Vay, evet
Şu ağaçları görüyor musun? Peki ya şu suyu?
Sanırım sorun falan yok
Hadi ama kardeşim, şükretmen gereken çok şey var
Aga.. Düşündüm de.. Haklısın
Çok haklısın ki çok haklıyım. Çok haksız olduğum bir gün bile hatırlamıyorum
Sağol Lil Boat, dostum
Kanka, bu yüzden buradayım

Son zamanlarda kafayı bulmuyordum...
Pekala, belki biraz bebeğim, yalan söylemek istemiyorum
Bana mesaj attığında, kızım, her zaman cevap vermiyorum biliyorum
Sen bir melek değilsin, uçamıyorsun bile
Fark ediyorum ki, bir şeyler bildiğini sanıyorsun
Tüm bu hayaletler bana doğru geliyor, kimin fırlattığını merak ediyorum
Vizyonu göremiyorlar, dostum dikkatlari dağılmış olmalı
Bu gerçekten güzel bir albüm ahbap, kim yazdı merak ediyorum, oh lanet olsun
Tamam, o zencilerin gitmesini diliyorum
Cirque Du Soleil gibi her zaman etrafta palyaçolar var
Bu bir albüm değil, hatta bunlar sadece gelişi güzeller
Bu şey çok soğuk, piyasaya sürüldüğünde kar günü olacak
Ayy, o iyi ve bunu biliyor, söylemiyor, sadece gösteriyor
Ben tıpkı DeRozan gibiyim, shoot atarsam girer
Cali'de güneşleniyorum, onlar o kadar ıslanıyor ki kızağa ihtiyaçları var
Oprah ile selfie'im var, sadece paylaşasım yok
Mutlu mekanımda takılıyorum, 2006' dan beri somurtmuyorum
2001' den beri ağlamıyorum, benim mekanım Six Flags gibi ve senin evin
Hiç eğlenceli değil
Benimkine geri de gelebilirsin, arkadaşın tatlı değil
Fakat sorun değil
Yüksek notada bitireceğiz

Küçük gözümle gözlüyorum
Elde edebileceğim bir kız çünkü çok fazla beğeni almıyor
Kıvırcık tatlı bir kız, karım olabilir
Dur, bu hep, sonsuzluk anlamına geliyor, bekle, boş ver
Oh, küçük gözümle gözlüyorum
Küçük gözümle gözlüyorum
Elde edebileceğim bir kız çünkü çok fazla beğeni almıyor
Kıvırcık tatlı bir kız, karım olabilir
Dur, bu hep, sonsuzluk anlamına geliyor, bekle, boş ver

Oh, küçük gözümle gözlüyorum
Gözlüyorum, küçük gözümle gözlüyorum
Oh, küçük gözümle gözlüyorum
Gözlüyorum, küçük gözümle gözlüyorum
Oh ben...

21 yaşında olduğunu söylüyor, kimlik görmem gerek
Bütün orospularım çift çift geliyor aşağıdaki taşaklarım gibi
Bir Hatchback'te şehri turladığım günleri hatırlıyorum
Genç goblinlerimle bir sorun arıyoruz
Modelimi evine boynundaki ağrılarla gönderiyorum
O kadar çok para kazandım ki durdurulamıyor
Kardeşlerim soyadım gibi yanımdadır
Herkese evcilleşmeyeceğimi söylediğim zamanlar aklımda
Woah, altı ay sonra ters döndüm ve şimdi oyundayım
Sahte zincir kolyelerden bambaşka seviyelerde elmaslar
""Beni buradan alabilir misiniz?"" sveiyesinden buraya geldim
Beni siklemeyen bir sürü insanı hatırlıyorum
Üniversiteye gittiler, şimdi hepsi tarih oldu
Dişimdeki altını elmasa dönüştürdüm
Arabamızda sert takılıyoruz, gizemli şeyler peşindeyiz (Raggy!)
Beni siklememeye devam et
Uzun zamandır lüks içinde yaşıyorum, hayır
Boat ve Kyle piyano tuşları gibi birbirinden ayrılmaz
Anneannemin üstüne yemin ederim ki asla bir orospuyu kondomsuz sikmem

Küçük gözümle gözlüyorum
Elde edebileceğim bir kız çünkü çok fazla beğeni almıyor
Kıvırcık tatlı bir kız, karım olabilir
Dur, bu hep, sonsuzluk anlamına geliyor, bekle, boş ver
Oh, küçük gözümle gözlüyorum
Küçük gözümle gözlüyorum
Elde edebileceğim bir kız çünkü çok fazla beğeni almıyor

44,Alessia Cara,Scars To Your Beautiful,"She just wants to be beautiful
She goes unnoticed, she knows no limits
She craves attention, she praises an image
She prays to be sculpted by the sculptor
Oh, she don't see the light that's shining
Deeper than the eyes can find it
Maybe we have made her blind
So she tries to cover up her pain and cut her woes away
Cause covergirls don't cry after their face is made

But there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
Oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

She has dreams to be an envy, so she's starving
You know, covergirls eat nothing
She says ""beauty is pain and there's beauty in everything""
""What's a little bit of hunger?""
""I can go a little while longer,"" she fades away
She don't see her perfect, she don't understand she's worth it
Or that beauty goes deeper than the surface, oh, oh
So to all the girls that's hurting, let me be your mirror
Help you see a little bit clearer the light that shines within

There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

No better you than the you that you are
No better you than the you that you are
No better life than the life we're living
No better life than the life we're living
No better time for your shine, you're a star
No better time for your shine, you're a star
Oh, you're beautiful, oh, you're beautiful

And there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful"

Or a nigga that could sing
And explain all the pain that it cost him
My sixteen should've came with a coffin
Fuck the fame and the fortune
Well, maybe not the fortune
But one thing is for sure though
The fame is exhaustin'
That's why I moved away, I needed privacy
Surrounded by the trees and Ivy League
Students that's recruited highly
Thinkin' ""You do you and I do me""
Crib has got a big 'ol back 'ol yard
My niggas stand outside and pass cigars
Filled with marijuana, laughin' hard
Thankful that they friend's a platinum star
In the driveway there's no rapper cars
Just some shit to get from back and forth
Just some shit to get from back and forth

To be the star you always knew you were

Some things you can't escape:
Death, taxes, and a ra-
-cist society that make
Every nigga feel like a candidate
For a Trayvon kinda fate
Even when your crib sit on a lake
Even when your plaques hang on a wall
Even when the president jam your tape
Took a little break just to annotate
How I feel, damn, it's late
I can't sleep cause I'm paranoid
Black in a white man territory
Cops bust in with the army guns
No evidence of the harm we done
Just a couple neighbors that assume we slang
Only time they see us we be on the news, in chains, damn

You took my heart and my keys and my patience
You took my heart on my sleeve for decoration
You mistaken my love I brought for you for foundation

Something that I never had
Something that you've never seen
Something that you've never been!

48,Starley,Call On Me - Ryan Riback Extended Remix,"When you're low
And your knees can't rise
You feel helpless
And you're looking to the sky
Some people would say
To accept their fate
Well, if this is fate then we'll find a way to cheat

Cause, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh we'll say a little prayer
But, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh if the answer isn't fair

You know you can call on me
When you need somebody
You know you can call on me
When you can't stop the tears from falling down (d-down)
You know you can call on me
Call on me, darling
You know you can call on me
You can't stop the tears from falling down (d-down)

When you're weary
And the road is dark
And I'll guide you
With the beating of my heart
And if the cavalry
And the help don't come
Well, then we'll find a way
To dodge a smoking gun

Cause, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh we'll say a little prayer
But, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh if the answer isn't fair (then call on me)

You know you can call on me
When you need somebody
You know you can call on me
When you can't stop the tears from falling down (d-down)
You know you can call on me
Call on me, darling
You know you can call on me
You can't stop the tears from falling down (d-down)

When you, you need someone (Just call on me)
You need somebody to cling to (Call on me)
When you, you need someone (Just call on me)
You need somebody to dry your tears
When you, you need someone (You can call me)
You need somebody to cling to (Just call on me)

Just call on me, love (Just call on me)
Just call on me, love (Call on me)
Just call on me, love (Just call on me)
Just call on me, love (Call on me)
Just call on me, love, on me"

50,The Weeknd,Six Feet Under,"Ask around about her
She don't get emotional
Kill off all her feelings
That's why she ain't approachable
She know her pussy got a fanbase
A couple niggas with a suitcase
Suit and tie niggas who play roleplay
When it comes to money she play no games

She lick it up just like a candy
She wanna make them leave their family
She trying to live a life so fancy
She wanna pull up in a Bentley
She ain't got time for lovin'
Louis Vuitton her husband
She rather die in lusting
She rather die in the club, 'til she

Six feet under she gon' get that fucking paper
Six feet under she gon' get that fucking paper
Six feet under she gon' get that fucking paper
You know how she get down, pop it for a check now
Six feet under, six, six feet under
Six feet under, six, six feet under
Six feet under she gon' kill me for that paper
Not the type to fuck around, gonna turn that ass around

She don't depend on anybody
Know just what to do with her own body
Counting all that money like a hobby
She don't give a fuck about nobody
And she got her whole crew poppin'
And she bend it over like she got no back bone
Got a couple niggas blinging up a trap phone
She don't need nobody waiting back home, she got it

She lick it up just like a candy
She wanna make them leave their family
She trying to live a life so fancy
She wanna pull up in a Bentley
She ain't got time for lovin'
Louis Vuitton her husband
She rather die in lusting
She rather die in the club, 'til she

Six feet under she gon' get that fucking paper
Six feet under she gon' get that fucking paper
Six feet under she gon' get that fucking paper
You know how she get down, pop it for a check now
Six feet under, six, six feet under (That fuckin' paper)
Six feet under, six, six feet under (That fuckin' paper)
Six feet under she gon' kill me for that paper
Not the type to fuck around, gonna turn that ass around

Gonna turn that ass around
Oh murder, oh murder
Gonna turn that ass around
Oh murder, oh murder

Real love's hard to find
So she don't waste her time
So she don't waste her time, oooh
You ain't gon' catch her crying
She ain't gon' lose her mind
She ain't gon' lose her mind
'Til she..

Six feet under she gon' kill me for that paper ('Til she)
Six feet under she gon' kill me for that paper ('Til she)
Six feet under she gon' kill me for the paper

52,Adele,Send My Love (To Your New Lover),"Just the guitar?
Okay, cool

This was all you, none of it me
You put your hands on, on my body and told me
Mmm, told me you were ready
For the big one, for the big jump
I'd be your last love, everlasting, you and me
Mmm, that was what you told me

I'm giving you up
I've forgiven it all
You set me free

Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more
Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more

I was too strong, you were trembling
You couldn't handle the hot heat rising (rising)
Mmm, baby, I'm still rising
I was running, you were walking
You couldn't keep up, you were falling down (down)
Mmm, there's only one way down

I'm giving you up
I've forgiven it all
You set me free, oh

Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more
Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more

If you're ready, if you're ready
If you're ready, I am ready
If you're ready, if you're ready
We both know we ain't kids no more
No, we ain't kids no more

I'm giving you up
I've forgiven it all
You set me free

Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more
Send my love to your new lover

53,John Legend,Love Me Now,"Pulling me further, further than I've been before
Making me stronger, shaking me right to the core
Oh, I don't know what's in the stars
Never heard it from above, the world isn't ours
But I know what's in my heart, if you ain't mine I'll be torn apart

I don't know who's gonna kiss you when I'm gone
So I'm gonna love you now, like it's all I have
I know it'll kill me when it's over
I don't wanna think about it, I want you to love me now
I don't know who's gonna kiss you when I'm gone
So I'm gonna love you now, like it's all I have
I know it'll kill me when it's over
I don't wanna think about it, I want you to love me now

Love me now, love me now
Oh, oh, love me now, oh, oh, oh, yeah
Love me now, love me now
Oh, I want you to love me now

Something inside us knows there's nothing guaranteed
Yeah, girl, I don't need you to tell me that you'll never leave, no
When we've done all that we could to turn darkness into light, turn evil to good
Even when we try so hard for that perfect kind of love, it could all fall apart

And who's gonna kiss you when I'm gone?
Oh I'm gonna love you now, like it's all I have
And I know it'll kill me when it's over
I don't wanna think about it, I want you to love me now

Love me now, love me now
Oh, love me now, oh, oh, oh
Love me now
Love me now, love me now
Love me now

Oh I don't know how the years will go down, it's alright
Let's make the most of every moment tonight

I don't know who's gonna kiss you when I'm gone
So I'm gonna love you now, like it's all I have
I know it'll kill me when it's over
I don't wanna think about it, I want you to love me now
I don't know who's gonna kiss you when I'm gone
So I'm gonna love you now, like it's all I have
I know it'll kill me when it's over
I don't wanna think about it, I just wanna love you now

Love me now, love me now
Oh, oh, love you now, oh, oh, oh
Love me now, love me now
Love you now
Oh, love you now, oh, oh, oh, oh"
54,Justin Bieber,Love Yourself,"For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake
You think I'm cryin' on my own, well I ain't

And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
And baby I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin'
I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from

And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
And baby I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin'
I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

For all the times that you made me feel small
I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
I never felt so low and I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself"

57,The Weeknd,Sidewalks,"Uh, uh, uh, uh-uh, uh, yeah, like

I ran out of tears when I was 18
So nobody made me but the main streets
'Cause too many people think they made me
Well, if they really made me then replace me
Homeless to Forbes List, these niggas bring no stress
I feel like Moses, I feel like I'm chosen
And if you ain't my nigga then your girl single to me
I don't give a damn if a nigga said he knew me
Grew up with no father so nobody ever ""son"" me
My flow too sick, Kevin Costner couldn't touch me
I know you wish that nobody ever love me
I feel useless when I'm never making money
Well, this the life we always fantasized
Rich folk problem through a Queen Street nigga's eyes
Every time you see me pulling up in Aventadors
Just know we been grinding on them sidewalks

Sidewalks saved my life
They don't ever lie
Sidewalks saved my life
They showed me all the signs

They don't let me down
But they lead me on
And they don't let me down
But they lead me on
And they lead me on

Say, say, say
I come from murder one, brung late night melee
Say, say, say
We hung all summer, sprung mattress with bae bae
Say, say, say
Trippin' off Dyke, and my name strike with pay day
Say, say, say
Flippin' blue lightning, tightening, strapped with AK
Say, say, say
OG one, told me one, show me one, eight ways
How to segue
Pussy, power, profit and headache
I reminisce my life innocence or life innocent
Or life intimate, with fame
Light limo tint with light women, dark women in it
Awe Kenny, good game
She wanna hang with a Starboy
The sun and the moon and star, boy
Astronomer, anonymous
I line 'em up, we grind 'em up, there's nine of us
And five of us have probably fucked
She mollied up, I tallied up all the parts, boy
Twenty legs, arms, head (Head)
Head, head, and more head (Head)
Oh God, bless the dead (Yah)
I'm livin' life, high off life
I wear my chokes off to bed
I'm the greatest nigga, why you scared to say it?
I wanna rock, I wanna rock
I wanna cop more land, I never stop
I wanna quick advance on a bill if it ain't one
Break everything, I'm a hustler, came from

Sidewalks saved my life
They don't ever lie
Sidewalks saved my life
They showed me all the signs

They don't let me down
But they lead me on
And they don't let me down
But they lead me on
And they lead me on"

64,Michael Jackson,Billie Jean,"She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said, ""Don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round?""
She said I am the one
Who will dance on the floor, in the round
She told me her name was Billie Jean
As she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

People always told me, ""Be careful of what you do
Don't go around breaking young girls' hearts"" (Hee-eeh)
And mother always told me, ""Be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do (Oh-oh)
'Cause the lie becomes the truth"" (Oh-oh)

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one (Oh, baby)
But the kid is not my son, hoo!
She says I am the one (Oh, baby)
But the kid is not my son (Hee-hee-hee, no-no-no, hee-hee-hee)
Hoo!

For forty days and for forty nights, the law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand?
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, hee!
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
(Don't think twice) Do think twice! (Ah-hoo!)
She told my baby we'd danced till three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo of a baby crying, his eyes were like mine (Oh, no)
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby
(Ooh, hee-hee-hee)

People always told me, ""Be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts""
(Don't break no hearts!) (Hee-hee)
She came and stood right by me
Then the smell of sweet perfume (Ha-oh)
This happened much too soon (Ha-oh, ha-ooh)
She called me to her room (Ha-oh, hoo!)

Billie Jean is not my lover (Hoo!)
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
No-no-no, no-no-no-no-no-no
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one (Oh baby)

66,J. Cole,Immortal,"Awwwww...haha

Now I was barely seventeen with a pocket full of hope
Screamin' ""dollar and a dream"" with my closet lookin' broke
And my nigga's lookin' clean, gettin' caught up with that dope
Have you ever served a fiend with a pocket full of soap?
Nigga I can tell you things that you probably shouldn't know
Have you ever heard the screams when the body hit the floor?
Flashbacks to the pain, wakin' up, cold sweats
Six o'clock in the mornin', gotta hit the BowFlex
Get my weight up on the block, keep watch for the cops
God they love to serve a nigga three hots and a cot
Nowadays crime pays like a part time job
And the drought got me prayin' for a Carl Thom vibe
Summer Rain come again
Numb the pain 'cause it's hard for a felon
In my mind I been cryin', know it's wrong but I'm sellin'
Eyes wellin' up with tears
Thinkin' 'bout my niggas dead in the dirt
Immortalized on this shirt

Real niggas don't die

Form at the plot
Real niggas don't die
Form on the block
Real niggas don't lie
Form in the plot
My niggas don't die

Have you ever seen a fiend cook crack on the spoon?
Have you ever seen a nigga that was black on the moon?
Have you ever seen your brother go to prison as you cry?
Have you ever seen a motherfuckin' ribbon in the sky?
Nope, all I see is that C.R.E.A.M nigga, that green
I'm a black king, black jeans on my black queen
And her ass fat, too fat for a flat screen
I'm the type of nigga make the whole fuckin' trap lean
Kingpin nigga, put wings on a crack fiend
If they want a nigga, they gon' have to send a SWAT team
And I'm goin' out like Scarface in his last scene
A legend, what that mean—?

Real niggas don't die
Real niggas don't die

To die a young legend or live a long life unfulfilled
'Cause you wanna change the world, but while alive you never will
'Cause they only feel you after you gone, or I've been told
And now I'm caught between bein' heard and gettin' old
Damn, death creepin' in my thoughts lately
My one wish in this bitch, ""Make it quick if the Lord take me""
I know nobody meant to live forever anyway
And so I hustle like my niggas in Virgini-A
They tellin' niggas, ""sell dope, rap or go to NBA""
In that order, it's that sort of thinkin'
That been keepin' niggas chained at the bottom and hanged
The strangest fruit that you ever seen, ripe with pain, listen..."

A bullet for them, a bullet for you
A bullet for everybody in this room

See many bullets comin' through
Metaphorically, I'm the man
But literally, I don't know what I'd do
""I'd live for you,"" an' that's hard to do
Even harder to say when you know it's not true
Even harder to write when you know that tonight
There were people back home who tried talkin' to you
But then you ignore them still
All these questions they're for real
Like who would you live for? Who would you die for?
And would you ever kill?

No role models and I'm here right now
No role models to speak of
Searchin' through my memory, my memory, I couldn't find one
Last night I was gettin' my feet rubbed
By the baddest bitch, not Trina but I swear to God
This bitch'll make you call your girl up
And tell her, ""Hey, what's good?""
""Sorry I'm never comin' home, I'ma stay for good.""
Then hang the phone up and proceed to lay the wood
I came fast like 9-1-1 in white neighborhoods
Ain't got no shame 'bout it
She think I'm spoiled and I'm rich 'cause I can have any bitch
I got defensive and said, ""Nah, I was the same without it.""
But then I thought back, back to a better me
Before I was a B-list celebrity
Before I started callin' bitches ""bitches"" so heavily
Back when you could get a platinum plaque without no melody
You wasn't sweatin' me

One time for my L.A. sisters
One time for my L.A. hoes
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who know

Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

I want a real love, dark skinned Aunt Viv love
That Jada and that Will love
That leave a toothbrush at your crib love
And you ain't gotta wonder whether that's your kid love
Nigga, I don't want no bitch from reality shows
Out-of-touch-with-reality hoes
Out in Hollywood bringin' back five or six hoes
Fuck 'em then we kick 'em to the do'
Nigga, you know how it go
She deserved that, she a bird, it's a bird trap
You think if I didn't rap she would flirt back?
Takin' off her skirt, let her wear my shirt 'fore she leave
I'ma need my shirt back (nigga, you know how it go)

One time for my L.A. sisters
One time for my L.A. hoes
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who know

Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

There's an old saying in Tennessee—I know it's in Texas, probably in Tennessee—that says, fool me once… shame on… shame on you. Fool me, you can't get fooled again

Fool me one time, shame on you
Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you
Fool me three times, fuck the peace sign
Load the chopper, let it rain on you
Fool me one time, shame on you
Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you
Fool me three times, fuck the peace sign
Load the chopper, let it rain on you

My only regret was too young for Lisa Bonet
My only regret was too young for Nia Long
Now all I'm left with is hoes from reality shows
Hand her a script, the bitch probably couldn't read along
My only regret was too young for Sade Adu
My only regret, could never take Aaliyah home
Now all I'm left with is hoes up in Greystone
With the stale face 'cause they know it's they song
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)

Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved"

Cuando estás bien te alejas de mí
Te sientes sola y siempre estoy ahí
Es una guerra de toma y dame
Pues dame de eso que tienes ahí
Oye, baby, no seas mala
No me dejes con las ganas
Se escucha en la calle
Que ya no me quieres
Ven y dímelo en la cara

Pregúntale a quien tú quieras
Vida, te juro que eso no es así
Yo nunca tuve una mala intención
Yo nunca quise burlarme de ti
Conmigo ves, nunca se sabe
Un día digo que no y otro que sí
Yo soy masoquista

Como tú me tientas, cuando tú te mueves
Esos movimientos sexys, siempre me entretienen
Sabes manipularme bien con tus caderas
No sé por qué me tienes en lista de espera
Te dicen por ahí que voy haciendo y deshaciendo
Que salgo cada noche, que te tengo ahí sufriendo
Que en esta relación soy yo la que manda
No pares bola' a toda esa mala propaganda

Pa', pa' que te digo na', te comen el oído
No vaya a enderezar lo que no se ha torcido
Y como un loco sigo tras de ti, muriendo por ti
Dime qué hay pa' mí, bebé (¿Qué?)

I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words
I wish I found some chords in an order that is new
I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang

But now I'm insecure, an' I care what people think

When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
We're stressed out

Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young
How come I'm never able to identify where it's comin' from?
I'd make a candle out of it, if I ever found it
Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one
It'd be to my brother, 'cause we have the same nose
Same clothes, homegrown, a stone's throw from a creek we used to roam
But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered
Out of student loans and treehouse homes, we all would take the latter

My-my-my name's Blurryface and I care what you think

Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality
Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low
Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me

Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters

Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooh (Any way the wind blows)
I don't want to die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?
Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very fright'ning me
(Galileo) Galileo (Galileo) Galileo, Galileo Figaro magnifico
I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity

Bismillah! No, we will not let you go
(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go

No, no, no, no, no, no, no
(Oh mamma mia, mamma mia) Mamma mia, let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me!

So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?
So you think you can love me and leave me to die?
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby!
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here!

I never seem to get it right, but I guess that’s how it goes
Ever since you came around, can’t nobody hold me down
You showed me how to find myself when I needed it the most

I been up all night, no sleep

Wide awake, that’s okay, as long as I’m with you

I’m never gonna find my way
If I don’t run to that goal
The past is the past, today is today
And there’s things I can’t control
The circles underneath my eyes
Tell the truth that I've been trying to hide
I’ve been waiting for you way too long
Won’t you come and take me home
Oh I, I’m praying this ain’t all a dream
Can you, you, wake me up before you leave

It hurts me every time I see you
Realize how much I need you

But morning's as dark as the evening before it and it's getting harder to breathe all alone
It's only me
My heart is broke and it don't believe you're gone
But the sleeve of scars on my arms brings you along to haunt me wherever I go

Why do I think that I need the worst thing that I ever chose?
Only let me in when convenient
On whim when you feel it
But not when I need you most
You said you'd never do nothin' to harm me

Don't you stop loving me (loving me)
Don't quit loving me (loving me)
Just start loving me (loving me)
Ooooooohhh

And babe I’m fist-fighting with fire
Just to get close to you
Can we burn something babe
And I run for miles just to get a taste
Must be love on the brain
That’s got me feeling this way
It beats me black and blue but it fucks me so good
And I can’t get enough
Must be love on the brain yeah
And it keeps cursing my name
No matter what I do
I’m no good without you
And I can’t get enough
Must be love on the.... brain"
94,J. Cole,Change,"My intuition is telling me there'll be better days, yeah
My intuition is telling me there'll be better days
I like this tone

Yeah, my intuition is telling me there'll be better days
I sit in silence and find whenever I meditate
My fears alleviate, my tears evaporate
My faith don't deviate, ideas don't have a date
But see I'm growing and getting stronger with every breath
Bringing me closer to Heaven's doors with every step
As we speak I'm at peace, no longer scared to die
Most niggas don't believe in God and so they terrified
It's either that or they be fearing they gon' go to Hell
Asking the Father for forgiveness, got 'em overwhelmed (Please, God, I want to go to Heaven)
As if He's spiteful like them white folks that control the jail
See I believe if God is real, He'd never judge a man
Because He knows us all and therefore He would understand
The ignorance that make a nigga take his brother life
The bitterness and pain that got him beating on his wife

I know you desperate for a change let the pen glide
But the only real change come from inside (Come from inside)
But the only real change come from inside (Come from inside)
But the only real change come from—
In cemeteries or in chains I see men cry
But the only real change come from inside (Come from inside)
But the only real change come from inside (Come from inside)
But the only real change come from—

Yeah, my chosen religion
Jesus piece frozen from sinnin'
Doin' dirt, hoping to God, He know my intentions
To see a million 'fore I see a casket
I got a baby on the way, know he gon' be a bastard
I'm living fast like I'm in a drag race, how that cash taste
When I was a senior, I was ballin' on my classmates
Niggas put three bullets in my car, one hit the gas tank
Know I got a angel cause I'm supposed to have a halo
Right now, my lifestyle destined for a federal facility
For my ability to make them birds fly
Fiends wanna get higher than a bird's eye view
And who am I to tell a nigga what to do?
I just supply, it's economics
My business ain't got the suit and tie
Keep a pistol at all times, niggas want what's mine
I can't oblige, dog, I work too hard
So reach for it, get referred to God, I'm going hard, nigga

I know you desperate for a change let the pen glide
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from—
In cemeteries or in chains I see men cry
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from—

Yeah, prodigal son, got a new gun
This one don't run out of ammo
Lately been working on my handles
Can I ball, become a star and remain my self?
If I fall, dust it off and regain my self
Fuck 'em all, they don't know all the pain I felt
I'm in awe, after all the fame I felt, I evolved
I no longer bury demons, I be a vessel for the truth until I'm barely breathing, I'm singing

Life is all about the evolution
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more
You can dream but don't neglect the execution
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more
Time is short that's what somebody told me
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more
Too short to keep following your homies
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more

I reminisce back to a time where niggas threw they hands
All of a sudden niggas pop a trunk and then we scram
Finger on trigger make a little nigga understand
What it's like to finally be the motherfuckin' man
Eyes wide that's from the power that the coward feels
Niggas die over bitches, disrespect, and dollar bills
Bloodshed that turned the city to a battlefield
I call it poison, you call it real (pop, pop, pop, pop)
That's how you feel?

Pistols be poppin' and niggas drop in a heartbeat
Scattered like roaches, a body laid on the concrete
A body laid on the concrete
Look, somebody laid on the concrete
No time for that, ain't no lookin' back, cause I'm running too
I made it home, I woke up and turned on the morning news
Overcame with a feeling I can't explain
Cause that was my nigga James that was slain, he was 22
(Last night at around...) He was 22
(22 year old black male, suspect, reporting live...)

(I swear to God, bruh)
We're gathered here today...
(I swear to God)
To mourn the life of James McMillan Jr
(I swear to God—nigga, I'ma kill them niggas, man)
A tragedy, another tragedy in the black community
(I promise you, bro...)
We got to do better, people
22 years old, this boy was too young
(I promise you, bro, I'ma kill them niggas, yo...)
Our condolences go to his family, our prayers
(I'ma kill them niggas myself...)
We know he's in a better place
We know he's in a better place
But this has got to end, ladies and gentleman
We've got to come together, this is—this is beyond words
Now I'd like to open this ceremony with a verse from—"

Still not understandin' this logic (Ayy)
I'm back and I'm better (And I'm better)
I want you bad as ever
Don't let me just let up
I wanna give you better
Baby, it's whatever
Somebody gotta step up
Girl, I'm that somebody, so I'm next up
Be damned if I let him catch up
It's easy to see that you're fed up
I am on a whole 'nother level
Girl, he only fucked you over 'cause you let him
Fuck him, girl, I guess he didn't know any better
Girl, that man didn't show any effort
Do all I can just to show you you're special
Certain it's your love that holds me together
Lately you say he been killin' the vibe
Gotta be sick of this guy
Pull up, skrr, get in the ride
Left hand is steerin' the other is grippin' your thigh
Light up a spliff and get high
Shawty, you deserve what you've been missin'
Lookin' at you I'm thinkin' he must be trippin'
Play this song for him, tell him, ""Just listen""

Don't
Don't

Girl, said he keeps on playin' games
And his lovin' ain't the same
I don't know what to say, but
What a shame
If you were mine you would not get the same
If you were mine you would top everything
Suicide in the drop switchin' lanes
And that thing so fire, baby, no propane
Got good pussy, girl, can I be frank?
To keep it 100, girl, I ain't no saint
But he the only reason that I'm feelin' this way
Givin' you the world, baby, when you get space
Pen game get me laid, baby, that's penetrate
Oh baby

Don't

H-Town got a nigga so throwed
Pour up, we can party some more
Yeah, got this drank in my cup
Got a young nigga feelin' so throwed
Spit fire in a world so cold
Young money got a nigga feelin' old
Spit fire in a world so cold
H-Town got me feelin' so throwed
H-Town got me feelin' so throwed
Ride paint and we sip 'til we fold
H-Town got me feelin' so throwed
Spit fire in a world so cold

With the four-track, bussin'
Halfway cross that city with the back (back) pack (pack), fat (fat) cat (cat), crushin'

Can we go back? This is the moment

Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can't hold us

Now, can I kick it? Thank you
Yeah, I'm so damn grateful
I grew up really wanting gold fronts
But that’s what you get when Wu-Tang raised you
Y'all can't stop me
Go hard like I got a 808 in my heartbeat
And I'm eating at the beat like you gave a little speed
To a great white shark on Shark Week, raw!
Time to go off, I'm gone
Deuces, goodbye, I got a world to see
And my girl, she wanna see Rome
Caesar'll make you a believer
Nah, I never ever did it for a throne
That validation comes from giving it back to the people
Now sing a song, and it goes like
Raise those hands, this is our party (Hey, hey, hey)
We came here to live life like nobody was watching (Hey, hey, hey, oh)
I got my city right behind me, if I fall, they got me (Hey, hey, hey)
Learn from that failure, gain humility (Hey, hey, hey)
And then we keep marching, I said

Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can't hold us

My habits, they hold me like a grudge
I promise I won't budge

108,PARTYNEXTDOOR,Come and See Me (feat. Drake),"Doesn't make sense now
Shit just got real, things are gettin' intense now
I hear you talkin' 'bout ""we"" a lot, oh, you speak French now?
Giving me the signs so I gotta take a hint now
I hit you up like ""Do you wanna hang right now?""
On the East Side and you know I'm with the gang right now
You say do I own a watch, do I know what time it is right now
It's after 2AM and that's askin' a lot of you right now

All she talkin' bout is, ""Come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me""
All she ever say is, ""Come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me""

I been up for two whole days thinkin' what I did to keep you goin'
Thumbin' through the voicemails that you left me tellin' me where I went wrong
I'll admit I'm sorry when I feel I'm truly sorry
Things change, people change, feelings change too
Never thought the circumstances woulda changed you
You said you never traded no
Yeah you said that
And I believed you when they told me don't
Yeah thought you meant that
But either way you're still invited and I can't even lie to you

Swear these days all you say is, ""Come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me""
All she hit me with is, ""Come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me""

Why you gotta start, girl, why you gotta start?
I know we make time for the things that we want
I know you got another nigga tryna play the part
Just 'cause he got a heart don't mean he got heart
Could be standin' in a field, and he still ain't in the field
If anything should change then I thought we had a deal
Lately you keep questionin' what you get out the deal
Doin' things to make me feel the way I make you feel
How hard is it to let you know when I'm comin' home?
That way you can be prepared
Maybe take a couple sick days and not miss pay
I don't even know what things are looking like inside of your place
Or how it's decorated
This thing is gettin' one-sided, I can't even lie to you right now
Yeah

All she talkin' bout is, ""Come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me""
All she hit me with is, ""Come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me"""

Oh, we don't talk anymore, like we used to do

I just heard you found the one you've been looking
You've been looking for
I wish I would have known that wasn't me
'Cause even after all this time I still wonder
Why I can't move on
Just the way you did so easily

Don't wanna know

I just hope you're lying next to somebody
Who knows how to love you like me
There must be a good reason that you're gone
Every now and then I think you
Might want me to come show up at your door
But I'm just too afraid that I'll be wrong

Don't wanna know
If you're lookin' into her eyes
If she's holdin' onto you so tight

Maybe it's his first time around
Doesn't speak the language
He holds no currency
He is a foreign man
He is surrounded by the sound, the sound
Cattle in the marketplace
Scatterings and orphanages
He looks around, around
He sees angels in the architecture
Spinning in infinity
He says, ""Amen and Hallelujah!""

Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like"
127,The Weeknd,The Hills,"Yeah
Yeah
Yeah

Your man on the road, he doin' promo
You said, ""Keep our business on the low-low""
I'm just tryna get you out the friend zone
'Cause you look even better than the photos
I can't find your house, send me the info
Drivin' through the gated residential
Found out I was comin', sent your friends home
Keep on tryna hide it but your friends know

I only call you when it's half past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe

I'ma let you know and keep it simple
Tryna keep it up don't seem so simple
I just fucked two bitches 'fore I saw you
And you gon' have to do it at my tempo
Always tryna send me off to rehab
Drugs started feelin' like it's decaf
I'm just tryna live life for the moment
And all these motherfuckers want a relapse

I only call you when it's half past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe

Hills have eyes, the hills have eyes
Who are you to judge? Who are you to judge?
Hide your lies, girl, hide your lies (Hide your lies, oh, baby)
Only you to trust, only you

I only call you when it's half past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me

128,Drake,Hotline Bling,"You used to call me on my
You used to, you used to
Yeah

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

Ever since I left the city, you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl, you got me down, you got me stressed out
‘Cause ever since I left the city, you
Started wearing less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

Ever since I left the city, you, you, you
You and me, we just don't get along
You make me feel like I did you wrong
Going places where you don't belong
Ever since I left the city, you
You got exactly what you asked for
Running out of pages in your passport
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

These days, all I do is
Wonder if you're bendin' over backwards for someone else
Wonder if you're rolling up a Backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you, gettin' nasty for someone else
You don't need no one else
You don't need nobody else, no
Why you never alone?
Why you always touching road?
Used to always stay at home
Be a good girl, you was in the zone
Yeah, you should just be yourself
Right now, you're someone else

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

Ever since I left the city…"
129,Jon Bellion,All Time Low,"I was the knight in shining armor in your movie
Would put your lips on mine and love the aftertaste
Now I'm a ghost, I call your name, you look right through me
You're the reason I'm alone and masturbate

I, I've been trying to fix my pride
But that shit's broken, that shit's broken
Lie, lie, l-lie I tried to hide
But now you know it

An example of the perfect candidate
Now, all your girlfriends say that you don't want to see me
You're the reason that I just can't concentrate

I, (I, I) I've been trying to fix my pride
But that shit's broken, that shit's broken

130,The Chainsmokers,Roses,"Take it slow, but it's not typical
He already knows that my love is fire
His heart was a stone, but then his hands roam
I turned him to gold and took him higher

Well, I'll be your daydream, I'll be your favorite things
We could be beautiful
Get drunk on the good life, I'll take you to paradise
Say you'll never let me go

Deep in my bones, I can feel you
Take me back to a time only we knew
Hideaway
We could waste the night with an old film
Smoke a little weed on my couch in the back room
Hideaway
Say you'll never let me go
Say you'll never let me go

Ahh, ahh, ahh

I don't want to hear
Chest to chest with you, I'm staring into a mirror

Out in the cold you have been

But I can't do this again

I can't keep you from harm

134,AC/DC,You Shook Me All Night Long,"She was a fast machine, she kept her motor clean
She was the best damn woman that I ever seen
She had the sightless eyes, telling me no lies
Knocking me out with those American thighs
Taking more than her share, had me fighting for air
She told me to come, but I was already there
'Cause the walls start shaking, the Earth was quaking
My mind was aching, and we were making it

And you shook me all night long
Yeah, you shook me all night long

Working double-time on the seduction line
She's one of a kind, she's just a-mine all mine
Wanted no applause, just another course
Made a meal outta me, and come back for more
Had to cool me down to take another round
Now, I'm back in the ring to take another swing
That the walls were shaking, the Earth was quaking
My mind was aching, and we were making it

And you shook me all night long
Yeah, you shook me all night long
It knocked me out that
You shook me all night long
It had me shaking
And you shook me all night long
Yeah, you shook me
Well, you took me


You really took me and
You shook me all night long
Ah, you shook me all night long
Yeah, yeah, you shook me all night long
You really got me and you, shook me all night long
Yeah, you shook me
Yeah, you shook me
All night long"

Swizz told me let the beat rock

For all my Southside niggas that know me best
I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex
Why? I made that bitch famous (Goddamn)

For all the girls that got dick from Kanye West
If you see 'em in the streets give 'em Kanye's best
Why? They mad they ain't famous (Goddamn)

Wake up, Mr. West! Oh, he's up!

That Benz Marina Del Rey coastin'
She in school to be a real estate agent
Last month I helped her with the car payment
Young and we alive, whoo!
We never gonna die, whoo!
I just copped a jet to fly over personal debt
Put one up in the sky
The sun is in my eyes, whoo!
Woke up and felt the vibe, whoo!
No matter how hard they try, whoo!
We never gonna die

I just wanted you to know
Get 'em!

139,Van Morrison,Brown Eyed Girl,"Hey, where did we go?
Days when the rains came
Down in the hollow
Playin' a new game
Laughing and a running, hey, hey
Skipping and a jumping
In the misty morning fog with
Our hearts a thumpin' and you
My brown-eyed girl
You, my brown-eyed girl

Whatever happened
To Tuesday and so slow?
Going down the old mine
With a transistor radio
Standing in the sunlight laughing
Hiding behind a rainbow's wall
Slipping and sliding
All along the waterfall, with you
My brown-eyed girl
You, my brown-eyed girl

Do you remember when we used to sing
Sha la la la la la la la la la la te da
Just like that
Sha la la la la la la la la la la te da la te da

So hard to find my way
Now that I'm all on my own
I saw you just the other day
My, how you have grown
Cast my memory back there, Lord
Sometimes I'm overcome thinking 'bout
Making love in the green grass
Behind the stadium with you
My brown-eyed girl
You, my brown-eyed girl

Do you remember when we used to sing
Sha la la la la la la la la la la te da
Sha la la la la la la la la la la te da la te da
Sha la la la la la la la la la la te da la te da"
140,Carly Rae Jepsen,Call Me Maybe,"I threw a wish in the well
Don't ask me, I'll never tell
I looked to you as it fell
And now you're in my way
I trade my soul for a wish
Pennies and dimes for a kiss
I wasn't looking for this
But now you're in my way

Your stare was holding
Ripped jeans, skin was showin'
Hot night, wind was blowin'
Where you think you're going, baby?

Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me maybe
It's hard to look right at you, baby
But here's my number, so call me maybe
Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me maybe
And all the other boys try to chase me
But here's my number, so call me maybe

You took your time with the call
I took no time with the fall
You gave me nothing at all
But still you're in my way
I beg and borrow and steal
At first sight and it's real
I didn't know I would feel it
But it's in my way

Your stare was holding
Ripped jeans, skin was showing
Hot night, wind was blowing
Where you think you're going, baby?

Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me maybe
It's hard to look right at you, baby
But here's my number, so call me maybe
Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me maybe
And all the other boys try to chase me
But here's my number, so call me maybe

Before you came into my life, I missed you so bad
I missed you so bad
I missed you so, so bad
Before you came into my life, I missed you so bad
And you should know that
I missed you so, so bad

It's hard to look right at you, baby
But here's my number, so call me maybe

Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me maybe
And all the other boys try to chase me
But here's my number, so call me maybe

Before you came into my life, I missed you so bad
I missed you so bad
I missed you so, so bad
Before you came into my life, I missed you so bad
And you should know that
I missed you so, so bad
So call me maybe"
141,Adele,Water Under the Bridge,"If you're not the one for me
Then how come I can bring you to your knees?
If you're not the one for me
Why do I hate the idea of being free?
And if I'm not the one for you
You've gotta stop holding me the way you do
Oh honey, if I’m not the one for you
Why have we been through what we have been through?

It's so cold out here in your wilderness
I want you to be my keeper
But not if you are so reckless

If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge

What are you waiting for?
You never seem to make it through the door
And who are you hiding from?
It ain't no life to live like you're on the run
Have I ever asked for much?
The only thing that I want is your love

If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge

It's so cold in your wilderness
I want you to be my keeper
But not if you are so reckless

If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge

Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge (Say it ain't so, say it ain't so)
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge (Say it ain't so, say it ain't so)
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge"

It's my house, come on, turn it up

Hear a knock on the door and the night begins
'Cause we done this before, so you come on in

Pour yourself something cold, baby, cheers to this

Sometimes you gotta stay in

Welcome to my duck off the crib, the spot, the pad
But my house is your house if you throwin' it back
Excuse me if my home's draining the sad
Soon as these happy faces land you can run with the cash
Homerun, slam dunk, touchdown pass
Mi casa es tu casa so it ain't no holding back
Another shot of vodka, you know what's in my glass
It's my house, just relax

Welcome to my house
Baby, take control now
We can't even slow down
We don't have to go out
Welcome to my house
Play that music too loud

I hear the secrets that you keep, keep, keep
When you're talk, talkin', talkin'

Wipe the...
Lies from your eyes
I see that you're not mine
I can see the lust in your eyes
You can't hide it
You can't be the one
I realize, we're divided

I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talkin' in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep, keep, keep
When you're talk, talkin', talkin'
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talkin' in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep, keep, keep
When you're talk, talkin', talkin'"
147,Lukas Graham,7 Years,"Once I was seven years old my momma told me
Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely
Once I was seven years old

It was a big big world, but we thought we were bigger
Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker
By eleven smoking herb and drinking burning liquor
Never rich so we were out to make that steady figure

Once I was 11 years old my daddy told me
Go get yourself a wife or you'll be lonely
Once I was 11 years old

I always had that dream like my daddy before me
So I started writing songs, I started writing stories
Something about that glory just always seemed to bore me
Cause only those I really love will ever really know me

Once I was 20 years old, my story got told
Before the morning sun, when life was lonely
Once I was 20 years old
(Lukas Graham!!!)

I only see my goals, I don't believe in failure
Cause I know the smallest voices, they can make it major
I got my boys with me at least those in favor
And if we don't meet before I leave, I hope I'll see you later

Once I was 20 years old, my story got told
I was writing 'bout everything, I saw before me
Once I was 20 years old
Soon we'll be 30 years old, our songs have been sold
We've traveled around the world and we're still roaming
Soon we'll be 30 years old

I'm still learning about life
My woman brought children for me
So I can sing them all my songs
And I can tell them stories
Most of my boys are with me
Some are still out seeking glory
And some I had to leave behind
My brother I'm still sorry

Soon I'll be 60 years old, my daddy got 61
Remember life and then your life becomes a better one
I made a man so happy when I wrote a letter once
I hope my children come and visit, once or twice a month

Soon I'll be 60 years old, will I think the world is cold
Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me
Soon I'll be 60 years old
Soon I'll be 60 years old, will I think the world is cold
Or will I have a lot of children who can hold me
Soon I'll be 60 years old

Once I was seven years old, my momma told me
Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely
Once I was seven years old
Once I was seven years old"
148,The Temptations,My Girl,"I've got sunshine on a cloudy day
When it's cold outside, I've got the month of May
I guess you'd say
What can make me feel this way?

My girl, my girl, my girl
Talkin' 'bout my girl, my girl

I've got so much honey, the bees envy me
I've got a sweeter song than the birds in the trees
Well, I guess you'd say
What can make me feel this way?

My girl, my girl, my girl
Talkin' 'bout my girl, my girl

Ooh, ooh
Hey, hey, hey
Ooh, ooh
Hey, hey, hey
Ooh, ooh, yeah

I don't need no money, fortune, or fame
I've got all the riches, baby, one man can claim
Well, I guess you'd say
What can make me feel this way?

My girl, my girl, my girl
Talkin' 'bout my girl, my girl
(Talkin' 'bout my girl)

I've got sunshine on a cloudy day (Woah, woah)
With my girl
I've even got the month of May
With my girl
Talkin' 'bout my girl"

Don't let me stay on your mind
Adderall and cheap wine
Just to stay awake in conversation
We were always so damn insecure
So how could we ever know for sure
And disregard the way I know we feel
That would make this city way too real

If we bump into each other
On a crowded street
It’s not us no more
It’s just you and me
We’re just strangers in passing casually
It’s not us no more
It’s just you and me

The shirt on my back with the rips
Gems in my golden necklace
You didn't give me none of this
There's nothing for me to miss
We were too young on the day we met
How could we say we would not forget
And in the shadows there's a place for us
Somewhere hidden they can't find our love
Don't let 'em know

If we bump into each other
On a crowded street
It’s not us no more
It’s just you and me
We’re just strangers in passing casually
It’s not us no more
It’s just you and me

Eazy, and these days it's just you and me
This shit is dead and gone, it's not what it used to be
Someone give a eulogy
Know I'm hard headed and I might of acted foolishly
But you the one to hold us down usually
We was in a limbo
But of all people you ain't have to fuck with him though
That was my homie I had gave y'all the intro
Some things fall apart and some get thrown out the window
Remember when we first met we might've been too young
But we was from The Bay so we both was going too dumb
I used to be the one for you now you got a new one
So till the next lifetime, maybe we can do some'n
Eazy

If we bump into each other
On a crowded street

We’re just strangers in passing casually
It’s not us no more It’s just you and me

171,The Clash,Should I Stay or Should I Go - Remastered,"As his cab turned by the end of the Pont Royal towards the Gare d'Orsay, M. Etienne Rambert looked at his watch and found, as he had anticipated, that he had a good quarter of an hour before the train that he intended to take was due to start. He called a porter, and gave him the heavy valise and the bundle of rugs that formed the whole of his hand baggage.
""Where is the office for forwarding luggage, my man?"" he enquired.
The porter led him through the famous panelled hall of the Gare d'Orsay, and M. Etienne Rambert satisfied himself that his trunks had been properly registered for Verrières, the station at which he had to alight for the château of Beaulieu.
Still attended by the porter, who had conceived a respectful admiration for him in consequence of the authoritative tone in which he demanded information from the various railway servants, and who scented a probable munificent tip, M. Etienne Rambert proceeded to the booking-office and took a first-class ticket. He spent a few minutes more at the book-stall where he selected an imposing collection of illustrated papers, and then, his final preparations completed, he turned once more to the porter.
""The Luchon train,"" he said; ""where is it?"" and as the man only made a vague gesture and growled something wholly indistinct, he added: ""Lead the way, and I will follow.""
It was now just half-past eight, and the station showed all the animation inseparable from the departure of main-line trains. M. Etienne Rambert hurried onwards, and reaching the platform from which all the lines begin, was stayed by the porter who was laden with his baggage.
""You want the express, sir?""
""No, the slow train, my man.""
The porter showed some surprise, but made no remark.
""Do you like the front or the back of the train?""
""The back by choice.""
""First-class, isn't it?""
""Yes, first-class.""
The porter, who had stopped a moment, picked up the heavy valise again.
""Then there isn't any choice. There are only two first-class carriages on the slow train, and they are both in the middle.""
""They are corridor carriages, I suppose?"" said Etienne Rambert.
""Yes, sir; there are hardly any others on the main-line trains, especially first-class.""
In the ever-increasing crowd Etienne Rambert had some difficulty in following the porter. The Gare d'Orsay has little or none of the attractiveness of the other stations, which cannot fail to have a certain fascination for any imaginative person, who thinks of the mystery attaching to all those iron rails reaching out into the distance of countries unknown to him. It is less noisy than the others also, for between Austerlitz and Orsay the traction is entirely electric. And further, there is no clearly defined separation between the main and the suburban lines.
On the right of the platform was the train which was to take Etienne Rambert beyond Brives to Verrières, the slow train to Luchon; and on the left of the same platform was another train for Juvisy and all the small stations in the suburbs of Paris.
Very few people were making for the train to Luchon; but a large crowd was pressing into the suburban train.
The porter who was piloting M. Etienne Rambert, set the baggage he was carrying down on the footboard of a first-class carriage.
""There is no one for the slow train yet, sir; if you like to get in first you can choose your own compartment.""
M. Etienne Rambert acted on the suggestion, but he had hardly set foot in the corridor before the guard, also scenting a generous tip, came to offer his services.
""It really is the 8.50 you want, sir?"" was his first enquiry. ""You are sure you are not making a mistake?""
""No,"" Etienne Rambert replied. ""Why?""
""A great many first-class passengers do make a mistake,"" the man explained, ""and confuse the 8.50 with the 8.45 express.""
As he spoke the guard took the baggage from the porter who had remained on the platform, and the porter, after being generously remunerated for his trouble by M. Rambert, hurried away to look for other travellers.
""The 8.45 is the express, isn't it?"" M. Rambert enquired.
""Yes,"" the guard answered; ""it runs right through without stopping at all the small stations as this train does. It goes in front of this one and gets to Luchon three hours earlier. There it is on the side there,"" and he pointed through the window in the door on the far side to another train on the next rails, in which a number of travellers were already taking their seats. ""If you prefer to go by that one, sir,"" he went on, ""there is still time for you to change; you are entitled to take your choice since you have a first-class ticket.""
But Etienne Rambert, after a moment's consideration, declined the suggestion.
""No: I would rather go by the slow train. If I take the express I should have to get out at Brives, and then I should be twelve or thirteen miles from Saint-Jaury, which is my destination; whereas the slow train stops at Verrières, where, by the way, I have already telegraphed to say I shall arrive to-morrow morning.""
He walked a little way along the corridor, assuring himself that the various compartments were still quite empty, and then turned to the guard.
""Look here, my man,"" he said, ""I am awfully tired, and I mean to get some sleep to-night; consequently I should like to be alone. Now where shall I be most quiet and undisturbed?""
The man understood. M. Etienne Rambert's enquiry about the place where he would be most quiet, was an implicit promise of a handsome tip if nobody did disturb him.
""If you like to settle yourself here, sir,"" the man answered, ""you can draw down the blinds at once, and I dare say I shall be able to find room for any other passengers somewhere else.""
""Good,"" said M. Rambert, moving towards the compartment indicated. ""I will smoke a cigar until the train starts, and immediately afterwards I will settle down to sleep. By the way, my man, since you seem so obliging, I wish you would undertake to call me to-morrow morning in time for me to get out at Verrières. I am desperately sleepy and I am quite capable of not waking up.""
The guard touched his cap.
""You can be perfectly easy, sir, and sleep without the least anxiety. I won't fail.""
""Very well.""
When his baggage had been stowed away, and his rugs spread out to make the seat more comfortable still, M. Etienne Rambert repeated his appeal, for he was an old traveller and knew that it does not do to rely too much upon the promises of chance attendants.
""I can rely upon you, can't I? I may sleep as sound as I like, and you will wake me at Verrières?"" And the more to assure himself that the guard would execute his orders he slipped a franc into his hand.
When he was left alone, M. Rambert continued his preparations for the night. He carefully drew down the blinds over the door and over the windows of the compartment that gave on to the corridor, and also lowered the shade over the electric light, and then, in order to enjoy the last puffs at his cigar in peace, he opened the window over the other door and leant his elbows on it, watching the final preparations being made by the travellers by the express on the other line.
The departure of a train is always a picturesque sight, and M. Rambert leant forward inquisitively to note how the passengers had installed themselves in the two compartments which he could see from his coign of vantage.
There were not many people in the train. As a matter of fact the Brives and Luchon line is not much used at this time of year. If the number of passengers in the express were any criterion Etienne Rambert might reasonably expect that he would be the only one in the slow train. But there was not much time for observations and reflections of this kind. On the platform for the express, which he got a glimpse of through the compartments, people were hurrying up their farewells. The passengers had got into their carriages, and the friends who had come to see them off were standing alone upon the platform. There was the sound of safety locks being fastened by porters, and the noise of trollies being wheeled along bearing articles for sale.
""Pillows! Rugs! Sweets! Papers!""
Then came the whistle of the guard, the shriller scream from the electric engine, and then, slowly at first but steadily, more rapidly as the engine got up speed, the express moved along the platform and plunged into the tunnel on the way to Austerlitz.
Meanwhile the guard of the slow train was doing wonders. Shamelessly resolved to assure perfect quiet to ""his"" passenger, he managed, without unduly compromising himself but yet without leaving any doubt about it in any mind, to insinuate discreetly that M. Rambert's carriage was reserved, so that that gentleman might count upon an entirely undisturbed night.
A few minutes after the express had gone, the slow train drew out in its turn, and disappeared into the darkness of the underground tunnel.
At the château of Beaulieu young Charles Rambert was just finishing dressing when a gentle tap sounded on the door of his room.
""It is a quarter to five, Charles. Get up at once!""
""I am awake already, Thérèse,"" Charles Rambert answered with some pride. ""I shall be ready in two minutes.""
""What? up already?"" the girl exclaimed from the other side of the door. ""Marvelous! I congratulate you. I'm ready too; I will wait for you in the dining-room. Come down as soon as you are dressed.""
""All right!"" the young man answered.
He wasted no time over his toilette, the more so because it was none too warm in his room, for at this early hour it was still quite dark; and then taking his light in one hand he opened his door carefully so as to make no noise, tip-toed along the landing, and went down the staircase to join Thérèse in the dining-room. The girl was an accomplished housekeeper already, and while waiting for the young fellow she had got a scratch meal together.
""Let us have breakfast quickly,"" she suggested; ""it isn't snowing this morning, and if you like we might walk to the station. We have plenty of time, and it will do us good to have a walk.""
""It will warm us up anyhow,"" Charles Rambert replied; he was only half-awake, but he sat beside Thérèse, and did justice to the preparations she had made.
""Do you know that it is very wonderful of you to get up so punctually?"" Mme. de Langrune's granddaughter remarked. ""How did you manage it? Last night you were afraid you would sleep on as usual.""
""It was not much trouble for me to wake up,"" Charles Rambert answered. ""I hardly closed an eye all night.""
""But I promised to come and knock at your door myself, so you might have slept without any anxiety.""
""That's so, but to tell you the truth, Thérèse, I was regularly upset and excited by the thought of papa arriving this morning.""
They had both finished breakfast, and Thérèse got up.
""Shall we start?"" she asked.
""Yes.""
Thérèse opened the hall door, and the two young people went down the flight of steps leading to the garden. The girl had thrown a big cloak over her shoulders, and she inhaled the pure morning air with keen delight.
""I love going out in the early morning,"" she declared.
""Well, I don't like it at all,"" Charles Rambert confessed with characteristic candour. ""Good Lord, how cold it is! And it is still pitch dark!""
""Surely you are not going to be frightened?"" said Thérèse teasingly.
Charles Rambert made an irritable movement of vexation and surprise.
""Frightened? What do you take me for, Thérèse? If I don't like going out in the early morning it's really only because it is cold.""
She laughed at him while they were crossing the lawn towards the out-buildings, through which she meant to get out on to the high road. As they passed the stables they came across a groom who was leisurely getting an old brougham out of the coach-house.
""Don't hurry, Jean,"" Thérèse called out as she greeted him. ""We are going to walk to the station, and the only important thing is that you should be there to bring us back.""
The man touched his cap and the two young people passed through the park gate and found themselves upon the high road.
It was still very dark, with just a wan reflection in the distance of the sky vaguely outlining some cloud-shapes to the eastward to give some promise of the day. There was no sound to break the silence of the fields, and as they walked briskly along Charles and Thérèse could hear their footsteps ringing on the hard surface of the frozen ground.
""It must please you awfully to be going to meet your father,"" said Mme. de Langrune's granddaughter half questioningly. ""It is a long time since you have seen him, isn't it?""
""Three years,"" Charles Rambert answered, ""and then just for a few minutes. He is coming home from America now, and before that he travelled in Spain for a long time.""
""He was travelling the whole time you were a child, wasn't he?""
""Yes, always: either in Colombia, looking after his rubber plantations there, or in Spain, where he has a good deal of property too. When he was in Paris he used to come to the school and ask for me, and I saw him in the parlour—for a quarter of an hour.""
""And your mother?""
""Oh, mamma was different. You know, Thérèse, I spent all  the childhood that I can remember at the school. I liked the masters and had good chums, and was very happy there, and if the truth must be told I looked forward with anything but pleasure to the holidays, when I had to go to my parents' house. I always felt a stranger with them; my real home was the school-room, where I had my desk and all my own interests. And then, you know, when one is little one doesn't understand things much; I didn't feel having hardly any family, very much.""
""But you loved your mother very much?""
Thérèse asked the question quite anxiously, and it was patent that she would have thought it dreadful if her companion had not had a real affection for his mother.
""Oh, yes, I loved her,"" Charles Rambert answered; ""but I hardly knew her either."" And as Thérèse showed her surprise he went on, telling her something of the secret of his lonely childhood. ""You see, Thérèse, now that I am a man I guess lots of things that I could not have had even a suspicion of then. My father and mother did not get on well together. They were what you call an ill-assorted couple. They were both very good, but their characters did not harmonise. When I was little I always saw mamma silent and sad, and papa active and on the go, and bright and talking at the top of his voice. I half believe he frightened mamma! And then my father was constantly away, whereas mamma hardly ever went out. When a servant took me to the house on Thursdays, I was taken up to say good morning to her, and I invariably found her lying on a sofa in her room, with the blinds down and almost dark. She just touched me with her lips and asked me one or two questions, and then I was taken away again because I tired her.""
""Was she ill, then?""
""Mamma always has been ill. I suppose you know, Thérèse, that three months ago—stay, it was just when I had taken my degree and went to Germany—she was sent to an asylum? I believe my father had wanted her to agree to undergo careful treatment of the kind long before, but she would not.""
Thérèse was silent for a few minutes.
""You have not been very happy,"" she said presently.
""Oh, it was only after I grew up that I felt unhappy. When I was a little chap I never thought of how sad it is to have no real father or mother. The last four or five years it has hurt me, but when he came to see me once at school, papa told me he would take me with him as soon as I had taken my degree and grown up. Last October, after my examination, he wrote and told me to be patient a little longer, and that he was hurrying on with the winding up of his business and coming back to France. That gave me a hope which has brightened these last few months, and will also make you understand why I am so pleased this morning at my fathers coming. It seems to me that a new life is going to begin.""
Day was breaking now: a dirty December day, with the light filtering through heavy grey clouds that drifted along the ground, hid the horizon, clung to the low hills, and then suddenly dispersed in long wisps driven by a keen breeze, that got up in gusts, and drove clouds of dust along the hard frozen ground.
""I have not been very happy either,"" said Thérèse, ""for I lost my father when I was tiny: I don't even remember him; and mamma must be dead as well.""
The ambiguous turning of the child's phrase caught Charles Rambert's interested attention.
""What does that mean, Thérèse? Don't you know if your mother is dead?""
""Yes, oh yes; grandmamma says so. But whenever I ask for particulars grandmamma always changes the subject. I will echo what you said just now: when you are little you don't know anything and are not surprised at anything. For a long time I took no notice of her sudden reticence, but now I sometimes wonder if something is not being kept back from me—whether it is really true that mamma is no more in this world.""
Talking like this Thérèse and Charles had walked at a good pace, and now they came to the few houses built around Verrières station. One by one, bedroom windows and doors were being opened; peasants were making their way to the sheds to lead their cattle to the pastures.
""We are very early,"" Thérèse remarked, pointing to the station clock in the distance. ""Your father's train is due at 6.55, and it is only 6.40 now; we still have a quarter of an hour to wait, and more, if the train is not punctual!""
They went into the little station and Charles Rambert, thankful for some shelter from the cold, stamped his feet, making a sudden uproar in the empty waiting-room. A porter appeared.
""Who the deuce is kicking up all this row?"" he began angrily, and then seeing Thérèse, broke off short. ""Ah, Mademoiselle Thérèse,"" he said with the familiar yet perfectly respectful cordiality that marks country folk, ""up already? Have you come to meet somebody, or are you going away?""
As he spoke, the porter turned a curious eye upon Charles Rambert, whose arrival had caused quite a sensation two days before in this little spot, where with but few exceptions none but people belonging to the neighbourhood ever came by train.
""No, I am not going away,"" Thérèse replied. ""I have accompanied M. Rambert, who has come to meet his father.""
""Ah-ha, to meet your papa, sir: is he coming from far?""
""From Paris,"" Charles Rambert answered. ""Is the train signalled yet?""
The man drew out a watch like a turnip, and looked at the time.
""It won't be here for quite another twenty minutes. The work on the tunnel makes it necessary to be careful, and it's always late now. But you will hear when the bell rings: that will be when the train is coming over the level-crossing; it will run into the station three minutes after that. Well, Mademoiselle, I must get on with my work,"" and the man left them.
Thérèse turned to Charles Rambert.
""Shall we go on to the platform? Then we shall see the train come in.""
So they left the waiting-room and began to walk up and down the whole length of the platform. Thérèse watched the jerky movements of the hands of the clock, and smiled at her companion.
""Five minutes more, and your father will be here! Four minutes more! Ah! There it is!"" and she pointed to a slope in the distance where a slight trail of smoke rose white against the blue of the sky, now clear of cloud. ""Can't you see it? That is the steam from the engine coming out of the tunnel.""
Ere she finished speaking the quivering whir of the bell echoed through the empty station.
""Ah!"" said Charles Rambert: ""at last!""
The two porters who, with the stationmaster, constituted the entire railway staff at Verrières, came bustling along the platform, and while the bell continued its monotonous whirring ring, pulled forward trucks in readiness for any possible luggage. Puffing portentously, the engine slackened speed, and the heavy train slowed down and finally stopped, bringing a noisy atmosphere of life into the station of Verrières that but a moment ago was so still.
The first-class carriages had stopped immediately in front of Charles and Thérèse, and on the footboard Etienne Rambert stood, a tall, elderly man of distinguished appearance, proud bearing and energetic attitude, with extraordinarily keen eyes and an unusually high and intelligent forehead. Seeing Thérèse and Charles he seized his baggage and in a twinkling had sprung on to the platform. He dropped his valise, tossed his bundle of rugs on to a seat, and gripped Charles by the two shoulders.
""My boy!"" he exclaimed; ""my dear boy!""
Although he had hitherto shown so little affection for his child, it was obvious that the man was making a great effort to restrain his emotion, and was really moved when he now saw him again as a grown young man.
Nor, on his part, did Charles Rambert remain unmoved. As if the sudden grip of this almost stranger, who yet was his father, had awakened a world of memories within him, he turned very pale and his voice faltered as he replied:
""Papa! Dear papa! I am so glad to see you!""
Thérèse had drawn tactfully aside. M. Rambert still held his son by the shoulders and stepped back a pace, the better to consider him.
""Why, you are a man! How you have altered, my boy! You are just what I hoped you would be: tall and strong! Ah, you are my son all right! And you are quite well, hey? Yet you look tired.""
""I did not sleep well,"" Charles explained with a smile. ""I was afraid I should not wake up.""
Turning his head, M. Rambert saw Thérèse and held out his hand.
""How do you do, my little Thérèse?"" he exclaimed. ""You have altered too since I saw you last. I left a little chit of a child, and now I behold a grown-up young lady. Well! I must be off at once to pay my respects to my dear old friend, your grandmother. All well at the château, eh?""
Thérèse shook hands warmly with M. Rambert and thanked him prettily.
""Grandmamma is very well; she told me to tell you to excuse her if she did not come to meet you, but her doctor says she must not get up very early.""
""Of course your grandmamma is excused, my dear. Besides, I have to thank her for her kindness to Charles, and for the hospitality she is going to extend to me for a few days.""
Meanwhile the train had gone on again, and now a porter came up to M. Rambert.
""Will you take your luggage with you, sir?""
Recalled to material things, Etienne Rambert contemplated his trunk which the porters had taken out of the luggage van.
""Good Lord!"" he began, but Thérèse interrupted him.
""Grandmamma said she would send for your heavy luggage during the morning, and that you could take your valise and any small parcels with us in the brougham.""
""What's that? Your grandmamma has taken the trouble to send her carriage?""
""It's a long way to Beaulieu, you know,"" Thérèse replied. ""Ask Charles if it isn't. We came on foot and the walk would be too tiring for you after a whole night in the train.""
The three had reached the station yard, and Thérèse stopped in surprise.
""Why, how's that?"" she exclaimed; ""the carriage is not here.  And yet Jean was beginning to get it ready when we left the château.""
M. Etienne Rambert was resting one hand on his son's shoulder, and contemplating him with an affectionate, all-embracing survey every now and then. He smiled at Thérèse.
""He may have been delayed, dear. I tell you what we will do. Since your grandmamma is going to send for my luggage there is no need for me to take my valise; we can leave everything in the cloak-room and start for the château on foot; if my memory serves me right—and it is a very good memory—there is only one road, so we shall meet Jean and can get into the carriage on the way.""
A few minutes later all three set out on the road to Beaulieu. M. Rambert walked between the two young people; he had gallantly offered his arm to Thérèse, who was not a little proud of the attention, which proved to her mind that she was now regarded as a grown-up young lady. On the other side of his father Charles made answer to the incessant questions put to him.
M. Etienne Rambert enjoyed the walk in the quiet morning through the peaceful country-side. With a tender half-melancholy he recognised every turn in the road, every bit of scenery.
""Just fancy my coming back here at sixty years of age, with a great son of eighteen!"" he said with a laugh. ""And I remember as if it were yesterday the good times I have had at the château of Beaulieu. Mme. de Langrune and I will have plenty of memories to talk over. Gad! it must be quite forty years since I came this way, and yet I remember every bit of it. Say, Thérèse, isn't it the fact that we shall see the front of the château directly we have passed this little copse?""
""Quite true,"" the girl answered with a laugh. ""You know the country very well, sir.""
""Yes,"" said Etienne Rambert; ""when one gets to my age, little Thérèse, one always does remember the happy days of one's youth; one remembers recent events much less distinctly. Most likely that means, my dear, that the human heart declines to grow old and refuses to preserve any but pictures of childhood.""
For a few minutes M. Rambert remained silent, as if absorbed in somewhat melancholy reflections. But he soon recovered himself and shook off the tender sadness evoked in his mind by memories of the past.
""Why, the park enclosure has been altered,"" he exclaimed. ""Here is a wall which used not to be here: there was only a hedge.""
Thérèse laughed.
""I never knew the hedge,"" she said. ""I have always seen the wall.""
""Must we go on to the main gate?"" M. Rambert asked, ""or has your grandmamma had another gate made?""
""We are going in by the out-buildings,"" the girl answered; ""then we shall hear why Jean did not come to meet us."" She opened a little door half-hidden among the moss and ivy that clothed the wall surrounding the park, and making M. Rambert and Charles pass in before her, cried: ""But Jean has gone with the brougham, for the horses are not in the stable. How was it we did not meet him?"" Then she laughed. ""Poor Jean! He is so muddle-headed! I would not mind betting he went to meet us at Saint-Jaury, as he does every morning to bring me home from church.""
The little company, Etienne Rambert, Thérèse and Charles, were now approaching the château. Passing beneath Mme. de Langrune's windows Thérèse called merrily up to them.
""Here we are, grandmamma!""
There was no reply.
But at the window of an adjoining room appeared the figure of the steward, Dollon, making a gesture, as if asking for silence.
Thérèse, in advance of her guests, had proceeded but a few yards when Mme. de Langrune's old servant rushed down the stone flight of steps in front of the château, towards M. Rambert.
Dollon seemed distraught. Usually so respectful and so deferential in manner, he now seized M. Rambert by the arm, and imperiously waving Thérèse and Charles away, drew him aside.
""It is awful, sir,"" he exclaimed: ""horrible: a fearful thing has happened. We have just found Mme. la Marquise dead—murdered—in her room!"""

Don't worry, be happy

And that will bring everybody down

181,A Boogie Wit da Hoodie,Timeless (feat. DJ SPINKING),"Mm, CP Dubb
Bitch, I'm really timeless
Let me beat it up like Jaegen

I cannot waste no time, bitch, I'm really timeless
I cannot leave my houses without diamonds
All the faces on my watches, jump out it
Change faces on the watches, now they frownin'
I probably spent the 100 thousand on fly shit
QP spent the 100 thousand on mileage
Bruce Lee kick it with me, I be stylin'
2 seater Bentley and it's topless
And she's topless, naked bitch driver
Papers and fronto wrapped around Sour
I cannot waste no time, bitch, I'm really timeless
I cannot waste no time, bitch, I'm really...

I cannot waste no time, bitch, I'm really grindin'
If I ever said, ""I love you"", I was lyin'
I fuck with you but you was always like a side bitch
Cause I can never put nothin' over grindin'

I just left my baby girl a message
I said, I won't be comin' home
Hah, that's a dub, bitch, I'm on the road
Hah, and I need 20 thousand for a show
Hah, I ain't walkin' through your club no more
Hah, But if Lust hit me up I'll go
Hah, SpinKing that's the fuckin' bro
Hah, I fuck it up, I fuck it up some more
We switch the flow up, if you a busta I'ma cut you off
Bitch I'm goin' up
Gettin' money, what the fuck you thought?
Nigga, hold up it get ugly
I'm a fuckin boss, hah
Good now but I started off
Just a young nigga runnin' 'round and the butter soft
Try to run down on me nigga you should knock it off
I ain't get lucky mothafucka
Took a couple loses, yeah
What u sayin'? You ain't really on shit
Got zippers on my jeans like I'm Billy on this
I ain't sippin' no more lean I've been trippin' off it
I've been pissin' codeine and I ain't wit the shits, woah
Rockstar lifestyle, might not make it
Wake up faded still end up drinking
Make-up on my t-shirt, I hate it
R.I.P. t-shirts, I hate it
Fall asleep, wake up still I'm faded
Bubba prolly lost 50 K in vegas
Pour up purple and then make it turn pinkish
Said that I was done with it but I'm still drinkin'
I can't waste no time, I can't waste no time with it
I can't waste no time, bitch, I'm really timeless
I can't waste no time, bitch, I'm really timeless"
182,Hearts & Colors,Lighthouse - Andrelli Remix,"Looking back when we were younger
Sneaking out to feed the hunger
Oh, nobody knows

Getting caught behind the station
Remember that policeman chased us
Oh, nobody knows

We have come so far
We can't turn back now
Let me walk you down this road

Follow me, follow me when its dark out
I will be, I will be your lighthouse
And if you're lost, ohhh
I'll lead you back home
Follow me, follow me

There was a time you told me secrets
But you were scared I wouldn't keep them
Oh, but nobody knows

We used to smoke and watch the airplanes
Making-out as the ground shake
Oh, still nobody knows

We have come so far
We can't turn back now
Let me walk you down this road

Follow me, follow me when its dark out
I will be, I will be your lighthouse
And if you're lost, ohhh
I'll lead you back home
Follow me, follow me
Follow me, follow me when its dark out
I will be, I will be...
Follow me, follow me when its dark out
I will be, i will be your lighthouse
And if you're lost, ohhh
I'll lead you back home
Follow me, follow me
Follow me, follow me
Follow me, follow me"
183,DJ Snake,Middle,"Starin' at two different views on your window ledge
Coffee has gone cold, it's like time froze

There you go wishin', floatin' down our wishin' well
It's like I'm always causin' problems, causin' hell
I didn't mean to put you through this, I can tell
Are we gonna sweep this under the carpet?

I hope that I can turn back the time
To make it all alright, all alright for us
I'll promise to build a new world
For us two with you in the middle

(You in the middle)
(You in the middle)

(Ly-, ly-, ly-, ly-)
Lyin' down beside you, what's goin' through your head?
The silence in the air felt like my soul froze

Am I just overthinkin' feelings I can sell?
This gut feelin' I'm tryna get off me as well
I hope we find our missin' pieces and just chill
Are we gonna sweep it under the carpet?

I hope that I can turn back the time
To make it all alright, all alright for us
I'll promise to build a new world
For us two with you in the middle

(You in the middle)
(You in the middle)

(You)
Thank the children, just thank the children
(You)
Thank the children, just thank the children"
184,Kevin Gates,Really Really,"Diamonds really diamonds
And I'm shining bright ‘cause I'm really grindin'
They ask me if I'm real, I say, ""Is you serious?""
My daughter gon' love this bitch here

All my diamonds shine ‘cause they really diamonds
Bad bitches in line, they be really trying
They ask me if I'm high, I say, ""Really really""
Got money on my mind, I say, ""Really really""
I look like I been ballin' ‘cause I'm really ballin'
I won't apologize, I'm not really sorry
They ask me if I'm lyin', I say, ""Really really""
I'm really out my mind, I say, ""Really really""
Really really

Make 'em believe, I made 'em believe
A lyrical song writer and he can sing
Bringing in money like raking in leaves
I was just trying to get paper to sneeze
Achoo, that was a blessing
She special to you, I don't look at her special
Actually, I treat her regular
Not being seen, we not making no spectacle
Gates had her first then he gave her to Kevin
All the above, we do all the et cetera
Scared of the feds, had to switch up my cellular
He talking reckless, don't call me back ever
Passing through Gardere to holler at Glover
Shout out to Black, shout out to Cedric
Grey Monte Carlo, cocaine 911
Just hollered at Trav, I'm like the Reverend
My section ridiculous, watch where you steppin'
Pockets on indigent, can't be too careful
Steve like 'em tall and when they yellow
Broke and in college, fresh with low mileage
I like 'em black, pretty white teeth
Body unique, booty on fleek
Jhené Aiko, chewing her cheeks
Groceries, please, you know that was me

All my diamonds shine ‘cause they really diamonds
Bad bitches in line, they be really trying
They ask me if I'm high, I say, ""Really really""
Got money on my mind, I say, ""Really really""
I look like I been ballin' ‘cause I'm really ballin'
I won't apologize, I'm not really sorry
They ask me if I'm lyin', I say, ""Really really""
I'm really out my mind, I say, ""Really really""
Really really

Diving be treacherous (Swim)
Pray to God that don't nobody mess with us (Him)
Keep it strong in case anyone testing us
Right or wrong, if it's this, you don't mess with it
When yo' bitch over here I don't mess with her
No detective work, I don't be questioning
Where she been, trying to read all of her messages
I don't speak on no man, that's irregular
Take her phone, disconnectin' her cellular
What you need that for undressin' her?
What you need that for caressin' her?
Spreading her legs 'bout to pleasure her
Pulling her hair from the back, go to pressin' her
Trying to see who tap first, made a bet with her
Relationship flaking, no eczema
She catching feelings, she say we inseparable
Oyster Perpetual, it's not a replica
Mustang GT in the streets, smoking vegetables
Trunk in the front, do it make me a elephant?
I really really put syrup in my beverages
Shopping in Beverly, check out my etiquette
Loving my swag, women tailor keep checking it
Carats, they glisten in all of my necklaces
Feeling myself, really thought it was evident

All my diamonds shine ‘cause they really diamonds
Bad bitches in line, they be really trying
They ask me if I'm high, I say, ""Really really""
Got money on my mind, I say, ""Really really""
I look like I been ballin' ‘cause I'm really ballin'
I won't apologize, I'm not really sorry
They ask me if I'm lyin', I say, ""Really really""

189,Big Sean,Living Single,"Uh-huh, oh, yeah, look

Okay I know what it feel like to be young and single
You know the life when your pockets got a bunch of singles
You know taking double shots, saying fuck a single
You know, hardly getting sleep but it's the fuckin' dream though
Look, I know what it feel like to think you found the one
Told mom that so many times that I'm sounding dumb
Cause she started to mix Ashley up with Tanesha
And saying ""Hi Britney"" when I'm on the phone with Lisa
Fuck it, I got some new hoes, I mean some XXX girls
Pussy get wet as an S-Curl
Then I started thinkin' 'bout my ex-ex-ex girl
And how it was the worst times but she was the best girl
You know, good girl, bad time, right place, wrong mind
Got my mind right, hit her back, brrr, the wrong line
(The number you dialed has been disconnected)
Man, but before I started feeling bad
My nigga text me like ""I got some hoes, hit me back""
Fuck it

Oh I could let you down
When you trip, I'll take you anywhere, I take ya
We get ahead, yup, she give me head, damn right
You know it ain't right if she ain't by my side
With this crazy, crazy world
Thank God I'm with my girl
We get ahead, yup, she give me head, damn right
You know it ain't right if she ain't by my side
With this crazy, crazy world
Thank God I'm with my girl

You be the momma, you be the daddy
Baby, we could play house, I'll change your addy
Or even change my palate and fuck with salad
Put me in the picture, let's change your avi, oh, oh, oh
Can't even stunt I was sprung from the jump
Never got head while flaming up the blunt
You were my first, I'm just saying
More folks should try it, it's crazy
Focus, selfish moments, on road, I done have my share
Flying out of town like baby don't mind my player
Sleepy arguments via texts while I buy my beer
And the air so tired I forget to recline my chair
Picture you in my head, a souvenir by my legs
Some scuba gear for the bed, we do it 'cause Simon says
Ain't a single living thing that likes living single
We good over here, that's all that we know

Oh I could let you down
When you trip, I'll take you anywhere, I take ya
We get ahead, yup, she give me head, damn right
You know it ain't right if she ain't by my side
With this crazy, crazy world
Thank God I'm with my girl
We get ahead, yup, she give me head, damn right
You know it right if she ain't by my side
With this crazy, crazy world
Thank God I'm with my girl

To the one girl guys who claim they don't need more
Like my nigga Henry, he married at 24
I'm like why nigga, why?
You supposed to be with her longer than your ass been alive?
He like, ""ahhh""
Fuck it, we about to do therapy
Aye, at least when I hit the doctor I'm carefree with no plan b's
You probably never got tested and have that type of clarity
I'd rather live my life with that lifetime guarantee
But I'm down to hear the stories about what your hoes do
It’s probably more entertaining than me talking about my wife down in Whole Foods
Or how when I'm with her I feel whole too
Go on, keep living that life you niggas know you too old too
Fuck it, I started laughing and pretend like I ain't listen
Even though he on target with everything I've been missing
The closest thing I had to that came in at 4 AM and out at 8 for work
And I'm the reason we ain't make it work
That's what makes it worse
Damn

Oh I could let you down
When you trip, I'll take you anywhere, I take ya
We get ahead, yup, she give me head, damn right
You know it ain't right if she ain't by my side
With this crazy, crazy world
Thank God I'm with my girl
We get ahead, yup, she give me head, damn right
You know it ain't right if she ain't by my side
With this crazy, crazy world
Thank God I'm with my girl"
190,Bryson Tiller,Let Me Explain,"It's been a long time
I guess I just miss the old days
You remember...all them times

You used to come keep me company
Tell me you love me and just me
Oh and it took a while to trust me
Girl I had to work for it
Still you don't judge me
I love the way you touch me
I'm feeling like I'm 'bout to lose you
With all the shady shit I do to you
Some things are better left unsaid
I can't get it out my head
Better left unsaid
Everything that I regret
No lie girl when I tell you, you a blessing (you a blessing)
Girl just let me make corrections, yeah
Damn, I've been stressing yeah
I've been really tripping babe
I learned my lesson, yeah
I still need you to listen, oh babe

Baby, oh
Yeah for sure
Don't be afraid
Don't be afraid

Don't be afraid to tell me that it's over
Tell me that it's over
No, I don't deserve you, the shit I never told you
There's too many things, I can't look you in the face
I just grab you by the waist and act like everything's okay
Bare with me girl, I'm trying to be honest
Tell you what you need to hear, just not yet
I'm barely getting started, I'm being cautious
Girl that's the hardest
All we been through, look what we've been through
Look at Jay and Bey, they going through some shit too
We made it through the struggle let's make it through this too
I got a confession, baby will you listen to it?

Listen to me yeah (oh yeah)
Oh if you'd just let me explain (just let me explain)
If you'd just let me explain (oh yeah)
Baby oh (baby oh)
Listen to me yeah (oh baby oh)
Oh if you'd just let me explain (baby oh)

191,Post Malone,Go Flex,"Lighting stog after stog, I choke on the smoke
They tell me to quit, don't listen what I'm told
They help me forget that this world is so cold
I don't even know what I'm chasin' no more
Tell me what I want, just keep searchin' on
It's never enough, cup after cup
Blunt after blunt, I wouldn't give one if I could find a fuck
Ha, ha, ha, uh, in the cut and I put that on my momma
And my bitch called talkin' 'bout some drama
I swear there ain't no time for women on the come up
It's either pussy or the commas

Man, I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check
Man, I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check

Uh, yeah, push the gas, get a motherfuckin' nose bleed
She ain't never met a youngin' do it like me
She got a man but she says she really like me
She doin' things to excite me
She sendin' all her friends snaps of my new tracks
'Cause all these hoes know what's about to come next
I hit my plug up, got the paper connect
I drop a couple bands I just wanna go

Man, I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check
Man, I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check

Knowing all of this, it just don't make a difference
I'm just talking shit to the ones that'll listen
I come with the heat man, I swear I'm never missing
And I'm still the same and I swear I'm never switching
Knowing all of this, it just don't make a difference
I'm just talking shit to the ones that'll listen
I come with the heat man, I swear I'm never missing
And I'm still the same and I swear I'm never switching

193,J. Cole,She's Mine Pt. 1,"I never felt so alive
I never felt so alive
I never felt so alive (I never felt so alive)
I never felt so alive (I never felt so alive)

Catch me, don't you—
Catch me, don't you catch me
I've fallen in love for the first time
I wanna cry
And I ain't even tryna fight it
Don't wanna die (Don't wanna die no more)
'Cause now you're here and I just wanna be
Right by your side
On any night that you be crying, baby
I'll dry your eyes
I'll dry your eyes

Every time you go to sleep you look like you in Heaven
Plus the head game is stronger than a few Excedrin
You shine just like the patent leather on my new 11's
You read me like a book like I'm the Bible, you the Reverend
Yeah, I wanna tell the truth to you
I wanna talk about my days as a youth to you
Exposing you to all my demons and the reasons I'm this way
I would like to paint a picture, but it'll take more than a day
It would take more than some years to get all over all my fears
Preventing me from letting you see all of me perfectly clear
The same wall that's stopping me from letting go and shedding tears
From the lack of having father, and the passing of my peers
While I'm too scared to expose myself
It turns out, you know me better than I know myself
Better than I know myself
Well how 'bout that?

She gets him (you get me)
She hugs him (you kiss me)
You tell me you miss me
And I believe you, I believe you
She gets him (you get me)
She hugs him (you kiss me)
You tell me you miss me
And I believe you, I believe you
Catch me, don't you—
Catch me, don't you catch me
I've fallen in love for the first time"

I got a million trillion things I'd rather fuckin' do
Than to be fuckin' with you, lil' stupid ass

I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
I don't, I don't, I don't give a fuck
Bitch, I don't give a fuck about you
Or anything that you do
Don't give a fuck about you, or anything that you do

I heard you got a new man, I see you takin' a pic
Then you post it up, thinkin' that it's makin' me sick (brr brr)
I see you callin', I be makin' it quick
I'ma answer that shit like, ""I don't fuck with you.""
Bitch, I got no feelings to go
I swear I had it up to here, I got no ceilings to go
I mean, for real, fuck how you feel
Fuck your two cents if it ain't goin' towards the bill
Yeah, and every day I wake up celebratin' shit
Why? ‘Cause I just dodged a bullet from a crazy bitch
I stuck to my guns, that's what made me rich
That's what put me on, that's what got me here
That's what made me this
And everything that I do is my first name (B-I-G)
These hoes chase bread, aw damn, she got a bird brain
Ain't nothin' but trill in me, aw man, silly me
I just bought a crib, three stories; that bitch a trilogy
And you know I'm rollin' weed that's fuckin' up the ozone
I got a bitch that text me she ain't got no clothes on
And then another one text, then your ass next
And I'ma text your ass back, like…

I don't fuck with you
You lil' stupid ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you
You lil', you lil' dumb ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you
I got a million trillion things I'd rather fuckin' do

I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
I don't, I don't, I don't give a fuck
Bitch, I don't give a fuck about you
Or anything that you do
Don't give a fuck about you, or anything that you do

Got a million things on my mind, executive deals online
Limited amount of time, chasin' these dollar signs
And you ain't on your grind
You liable to find me up in the MGM casino in the D
Fuckin' off fetti I could've put on property
From the Bay to the Murder Mitten
My niggas put murder missions
She choosin', that's her decision, free my niggas in prison
On the phone with a bitch who can't do shit
For a pimp but make a nigga hella rich
Got a blunt in my dental, blowin' hemp in a rental
On my way to Sacramento, late night; Arsenio
I'm never sentimental, go hard or go homeless
Barely Harley, I'm chromeless, you might end up domeless
I bet you she into me, her cheddar, she givin' me
I'll make a bitch stand outside forever, like the Statue of Liberty
Rest in pimp, Pimp C, underground king of the South
I raise my styrofoam up, and pour some drink in my mouth
Why you always coming around with bad news?
Say you want me to win, but hope I lose
Askin' if I rock with other niggas in the crew
But them niggas cool, it's just that…

Bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you (Lil biatch!)
You lil' stupid ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you (Nuh-uh!)

I don't, I don't, I don't give a fuck
Bitch, I don't give a fuck about you
Or anything that you do
Don't give a fuck about you, or anything that you do

I got a new chick that I gotta thank God for
I got a new whip that I gotta thank the lot for
Yeah, I got a lot but want a lot more
Yeah, we in the buildin', but I'm tryna take it to the top floor
I swear I hear some new bullshit every day I'm wakin' up
It seem like nowadays everybody breakin' up
That shit can break you down if you lose a good girl
I guess you need a bad bitch to come around and make it up
I guess drama makes for the best content
Everything got a bad side, even a conscience
Now you're drinkin' 'til you're unconscious
Feel me when you get a fine bitch
Just don't forget to read the fine print
Life got me meditatin' like I'm in the Himalayas
Keep it G with the L lit on me like the elevator
Yeah, I know that karma's too real
So I hope you doin' cool, but still…

Stupid ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you
Little stupid ass… I ain't fuckin with…

INT. PASTELS RESTAURANT- NIGHT
An insanely expensive restaurant on the Upper East Side.
The decor is a mixture of chi-chi and rustic, with swagged
silk curtains, handwritten menus and pale pink tablecloths
decorated with arrangements of moss, twigs and hideous
exotic flowers. The clientele is young, wealthy and
confident, dressed in the height of late-eighties style:
pouffy Lacroix dresses, slinky Alaïa, Armani power suits.
CLOSE-UP on a WAITER reading out the specials.
WAITER
With goat cheese profiteroles and I also have an arugula
Caesar salad. For entrées tonight I have a swordfish
meatloaf with onion marmalade, a rare-roasted partridge
breast in raspberry coulis with a sorrel timbale...
Huge white porcelain plates descend on very pale pink linen
table cloths. Each of the entrees is a rectangle about four
inches square and look exactly alike.
CLOSE-UP on various diners as we hear fragments of
conversation. ""Is that Charlie Sheen over there?"" ""Excuse
me? I ordered cactus pear sorbet.""
WAITER
And grilled free-range rabbit with herbed French fries. Our
pasta tonight is a squid ravioli in a lemon grass broth...
CLOSE-UP on porcelain plates containing elaborate
perpendicular desserts descending on another table.
PATRICK BATEMAN, TIMOTHY PRICE, CRAIG MCDERMOTT and DAVID
VAN PATTEN are at a table set for four. They are all wearing
expensively cut suits and suspenders and have slicked-back
hair. Van Patten wears horn-rimmed glasses.
The camera moves in on Bateman as his narration begins:
BATEMAN (V.O.)
We're sitting in Pastels, this nouvelle Northern California
place on the Upper East Side.
The Waiter sets down plates containing tiny, elaborately
decorated starters. As he does so we hear Bateman's
description of each of the men at the table.
BATEMAN (V.O.)
You'll notice that my friends and I all look and behave in
a remarkably similar fashion, but there are subtle differences
between us. McDermott is the biggest asshole. Van
Patten is the yes man. Price is the most wired. I'm the
best looking. We all have light tans. Right now I'm in a
bad mood because this is not a good table, and Van Patten
keeps asking dumb, obvious questions about how to dress.
VAN PATTEN
What are the rules for a sweater vest?
McDERMOTT
What do you mean?
PRICE
Yes. Clarify.
McDERMOTT
Well, is it strictly informal-
BATEMAN
Or can it be worn with a suit?
McDERMOTT
(Smiling)
Exactly
BATEMAN
With discreet pinstripes you should wear a subdued blue or
charcoal gray vest. A plaid suit would cal I for a bolder
vest.
McDERMOTT
But avoid matching the vest's pattern with your socks or
tie. Wearing argyle socks with an argyle vest will look
too studied.
VAN PATTEN
You think so?
PRICE
You'll look like you consciously worked for the look.
VAN PATTEN
Good point. Excuse me, gentlemen.
Van Patten leaves the table. As he does so, a busboy
discreetly removes their largely untouched plates.
BATEMAN
Van Patten looks puffy. Has he stopped working out?
PRICE
It looks that way, doesn't it?
McDERMOTT
(Staring at retreating waiter)
Did he just take our plates away?
PRICE
He took them away because the portions are so small he
probably thought we were finished. God, I hate this place.
This is a chicks' restaurant. Why aren't we at Dorsia?
McDERMOTT
Because Bateman won't give the maitre d' head.
(He guffaws)
Bateman throws a swizzle stick at him.
McDermott scans the room, settling on a handsome young man
with slicked-back hair and horn-rimmed glasses.
McDERMOTT
Is that Reed Robinson over there?
PRICE
Are you freebasing or what? That's not Robinson.
McDERMOTT
Who is it then?
PRICE
That's Paul Owen.
BATEMAN
That's not Paul Owen. Paul Owen's on the other side of the
room. Over there.
He points to another handsome young man with slicked-back
hair and horn-rimmed glasses.
McDERMOTT
Who is he with?
PRICE
(Distracted by the waitress's
cleavage as she bends over to
uncork a bottle of wine – the
waitress glares at him)
Some weasel from Kicker Peabody.
Van Patten returns.
VAN PATTEN
They don't have a good bathroom to do coke in.
McDERMOTT
Are you sure that's Paul Owen over there?
PRICE
Yes. McDufus, I am.
McDERMOTT
He's handling the Fisher account.
PRICE
Lucky bastard.
McDERMOTT
Lucky Jew bastard.
BATEMAN
Oh Jesus, McDermott, what does that have to do with
anything?
McDERMOTT
Listen. I've seen the bastard sitting in his office on the
phone with CEOs, spinning a fucking menorah. The
bastard brought a Hanukkah bush into the office last December.
BATEMAN
You spin a dreidel, McDermott, not a menorah.
You spin a dreidel.
McDERMOTT
Oh my God. Bateman, do you want me to fry you up
some fucking potato pancakes? Some latkes?
BATEMAN
No. Just cool it with the anti-Semitic remarks.
McDERMOTT
Oh I forgot. Bateman's dating someone from the
ACLU.
Price leans over and pats Bateman on the back.
PRICE
The voice of reason. The boy next door. And speaking
of reasonable...
He shows McDermott the bill for the meal.
McDERMOTT
Only $470.
VAN PATTEN
(Without irony)
Not bad.
The others murmur agreement. Four platinum Amex cards slap
down on the table.
INT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT
Bateman is pouring vintage champagne into flutes. Price is
lighting up a cigar.
McDERMOTT
Last week I picked up this Vassar chick-
VAN PATTEN
Oh God, I was there. I don't need to hear this
story again.
McDERMOTT
But I never told you what happened afterwards. So
okay, I pick up this Vassar chick at Tunnel-hot number, big
tits, great legs, this chick was a little hardbody-and so I
buy her a couple of champagne kirs and she's in the city on
spring break and she's practically blowing me in the
Chandelier Room and so I take her back to my place-
BATEMAN
Whoa, wait. May I ask where Pamela is during all
this?
McDERMOTT
Oh fuck you. I want a blowjob, Bate-man. I want a chick
who's gonna let me-
VAN PATTEN
(Putting his hands over his ears)
I don't want to hear this. He's going to say something
disgusting.
McDERMOTT
You prude. Listen, we're not gonna invest in a co-op
together or jet down to Saint Bart's. I just want some
chick whose face I can sit on for thirty, forty minutes.
Price throws a cigar at McDermott, who catches it.
McDERMOTT
Anyway, so we're back at my place and listen to
this. She's had enough champagne by now to get a fucking
rhino tipsy, and get this-
VAN PATTEN
She let you fuck her without a condom?
McDERMOTT
This is a Vassar girl. She's not from Queens. She
would only-are you ready?
(Dramatic pause)
She would only give me a handjob, and get this...she kept
her glove on.
The men sit in shocked, horrified silence.
ALL IN UNISON Never date a Vassar girl.
EXT. TUNNEL NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT
The limo pulls up to the sidewalk outside the Tunnel.
McDermott holds the door open for a passing HOMELESS MAN,
who looks confused.
McDERMOTT
I suppose he doesn't want the car. Price, ask
him if he takes American Express.
PRICE
(Offering card)
You take Amex, dude?
The man stumbles away. The club DOORMAN, seeing the limousine,
unhooks the
velvet rope and welcomes them inside.
INT. LADIES ROOM, TUNNEL - NIGHT
Brilliant white light, a bemused elderly female attendant in a
black-and-white maid's uniform trying to give out paper towels.
MUSIC thuds through an open doorway. Trashed-looking girls
stare into mirrors repairing their eye make-up or sit on the
counter chatting to friends. There are almost as many men as
women in the room. Couples stand in line, twitching as they
wait to do coke. As soon as one bathroom door opens, a couple
lurches out rubbing their noses while another couple rushes
past them and slams the door.
PRICE
There's this theory out now that if you can catch the
AIDS virus through having sex with someone who is infected,
then you can also catch anything-Alzheimer's, muscular
dystrophy, hemophilia, leukemia, diabetes, dyslexia, for
Christ's sake-you can get dyslexia from pussy-
BATEMAN
I'm not sure, guy, but I don't think dyslexia is a
virus.
PRICE
Oh, who knows? They don't know that. Prove it.
Price and Bateman finally get a stall and rush in. Price is
sweating.
PRICE
I'm shaking. You open it.
Bateman opens a tiny packet of coke.
PRICE
Jeez. That's not a helluva lot, is it?
BATEMAN
Maybe it's just the light.
PRICE
Is he fucking selling it by the milligram? (He dips
the corner of his Amex card in the packet and takes a snort)
Oh my God...
BATEMAN
What?
PRICE
It's a fucking milligram of Sweet'n Low!
Bateman dips his Amex in the envelope and snorts.
BATEMAN
It's definitely weak but I have a feeling if we do
enough of it we'll be okay.
PRICE
I want to get high off this; Bateman, not sprinkle it
on my fucking All-Bran.
The GUY IN STALL next door yells at them in an effeminate
voice:
GUY IN STALL
Could you keep it down, I'm trying to do drugs!
Price pounds his fist against the stall.
PRICE
(screaming)
SHUT UP!
BATEMAN
Calm down. Let's do it anyway
PRICE
I guess you're right...
(Raising his voice)
THAT IS, IF THE FAGGOT IN THE NEXT STALL THINKS IT'S OKAY!
GUY IN STALL
Fuck you!
PRICE
(Trying to climb up against the aluminum divider)
No, FUCK YOU!!
(He collapses, panting against the stall door)
Sorry, dude. Steroids...Okay, let's do it.
BATEMAN
That's the spirit.
They both dig their platinum Amex cards into the envelope
of white powder, shoveling it up their noses, then sticking
their fingers in to catch the residue and rubbing it into
their gums.
INT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT
Bateman saunters toward the bar as ""Pump Up the Volume""
plays in the background.
BATEMAN (to BARGIRL) Two Stoli on the rocks.
He hands her two drink tickets.
BARGIRL
It's after eleven. Those aren't good anymore. It's
a cash bar. That'll be twenty-five dollars.
Bateman pulls out an expensive-looking wallet and hands her
a $50.
She turns her back and searches the cash register for
change.
BATEMAN You are a fucking ugly bitch I want to stab to
death and then play around with your blood.
The music muffles his voice. She turns around. He is
smiling at her. She gives him his change impassively.
INT. BATEMAN'S APARTMENT- MORNING
Tableaux of Bateman's apartment in the early morning light.
A huge white living room with floor-to-ceiling windows
looking out over Manhattan, decorated in expensive, minimalist
high style: bleached oak floors, a huge white sofa, a large
Baselitz painting (hung upside down) and much expensive
electronic equipment. The room is impeccably neat, and oddly
impersonal - as if it had sprung straight from the pages of
a design magazine.
BATEMAN (V.0.)
My name is Patrick Bateman. I am
twenty-six years old. I live in the American Garden
Buildings on West Eighty-First Street, on the eleventh
floor Tom Cruise lives in the penthouse.
Bateman walks into his bathroom, urinates while trying to
see his reflection in a poster for Les Miserables above his
toilet.
BATEMAN
(V.0.) I believe in taking care of myself, in a
balanced diet, in a rigorous exercise routine. In the
morning, if my face is a little puffy, I'll put on an ice
pack while doing my stomach crunches. I can do a thousand
now.
Bateman ties a plastic ice pack around his face.
Bateman does his morning stretching exercises in the living
room wearing the ice pack.
CUT TO:
A mirror-lined bathroom. Bateman is luxuriating in the
shower steam, scrubbing his body, admiring his muscles.
BATEMAN (V.O.)
After I remove the icepack, I use a deep
pore-cleanser lotion. In the shower, I use a
water-activated gel cleanser, then a honey-almond body
scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub.
Bateman stands in front of a massive marble sink applying a
gel facial masque.
BATEMAN (V.O.)
Then I apply an herb mint facial masque which
I leave on for ten minutes while I prepare the rest of my
routine.
Bateman opens the door of a mirrored cabinet, which is
stocked with immaculate rows of skin care products. He
begins selecting bottles jars and brushes, laying them in
readiness on the marble counter.
BATEMAN (V.O.)
I always use an after-shave lotion with little
or no alcohol because alcohol dries your face out and makes
you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye
balm, followed by a final moisturizing ""protective"" lotion...
Bateman stares into the mirror. The masque has dried,
giving his face a strange distorted look as if it has been
wrapped in plastic. He begins slowly peeling the gel masque
off his face.
BATEMAN (V.O.)
There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman, some
kind of abstraction, hut there is no real me, only an
entity, something illusory, and though I can hide my cold
gaze and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping you
and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably
comparable: I simply am not there.
INT. BATEMAN BEDROOM - MORNING
Another huge white room, equally minimal: a futon, rumpled
white sheets, a bedside lamp with a halogen bulb, and a large
expensive painting (Eric Fischl or David Salle) chosen by
Bateman's interior decorator.
Dressed in silk boxer shorts, Bateman stands in front of a
huge walk-in closet, filled with rows of expensive shirts,
shoes and designer suits, organized according to color and
tone.
BATEMAN (V.O.)
It is hard for me to make sense on any given
level. My self is fabricated, an aberration. My personality
is sketchy and unformed, my heartlessness goes deep and is
persistent.
Fully dressed in Armani, Bateman stands in front of a
full-length mirror in the middle of his vast bedroom,
adjusting his cuff-links.
BATEMAN (V.0.)
My conscience, my pity, my hopes disappeared
a long time ago, if they ever did exist.
He gives a last look at the mirror and likes what he sees.
He gives his reflection a smile.
INT. OFFICES OF PIERCE & PIERCE - DAY
As Bateman walks down the corridor, he passes another MAN who
looks just like him.
MAN
Morning, Hamilton. Nice tan.
Bateman walks past the desk of JEAN, his secretary, pulling
his Walkman from around his neck. Jean is attractive,
wholesome, earnest. She smiles shyly. She loves him.
JEAN
Late?
BATEMAN
Aerobics class. Sorry. Any messages?
JEAN
Ricky Hendricks has to cancel today. He didn't say what
he was canceling or why.
BATEMAN
I occasionally box with Ricky at the Harvard Club.
Anyone else?
JEAN
And...Spencer wants to meet you for a drink at Fluties Pier 17.
BATEMAN
When?
JEAN
After six.
BATEMAN
Negative. Cancel it.
Jean follows him into his office.
JEAN
Oh? And what should I say?
BATEMAN
Just...say...no.
JEAN
Just say no?
Jean stands at his desk, waiting for instructions.
BATEMAN
Okay, Jean. I need reservations for three at Camols
at twelve-thirty, and if not there, try Crayons. All
right?
JEAN
(Playfully)
Yes, sir.
She turns to leave.
BATEMAN
Oh wait. And I need reservations for two at Arcadia at eight
tonight.
Jean turns around.
JEAN
Oh, something. . romantic?
BATEMAN
No, silly. Forget it. I'll make them. Thanks.
JEAN
I'll do it.
BATEMAN
No. No. Be a doll and just get me a Perrier, okay?
JEAN
You look nice today.
Jean exits. Bateman straightens some magazines in his
office, lifts a painting off the wall and puts it back at a
slightly different angle. He fiddles with some pencils in a
beer stein. He puts on some MUSIC and flips through a
Sports Illustrated. He buzzes Jean. She comes in a moment
later with the Perrier and a file.
JEAN
Yes?
BATEMAN
Is that the Ransom file? Thanks. Don't wear that
outfit again.
JEAN
Ummm...what? I didn't hear you.
BATEMAN
I said ""Do not wear that outfit again."" Wear a
dress. A skirt or something.
Jean stands there, then looks down at herself.
JEAN
(Smiling bravely)
You don't like this, I take it?
BATEMAN
Come on, you're prettier than that.
JEAN
(Sarcastically)
Thanks, Patrick.
The phone RINGS and Jean turns to leave.
BATEMAN
I'm not here. And high heels. I like high heels.
As Jean leaves, Bateman clicks on the TV set in one corner
of the room and starts watching Jeopardy!
INT. TAXI - EVENING
EVELYN WILLIAMS, Patrick Bateman's
fiancée, is making notes with a gold Cross pen and sipping
a bottle of mineral water. Evelyn is blonde, classically
beautiful, expensively educated, and utterly pleased with
herself. She usually addresses Patrick as if he were a
small child.
EVELYN
I'd want a zydeco band, Patrick. That's what I'd
want, a zydeco band. Or mariachi. Or reggae. Something
ethnic to shock Daddy Oh, I can't decide...And lots
of chocolate truffles. Godiva. And oysters on the halfshell.
CLOSE-UP on Bateman, who is wearing a Walkman and staring
out the window.
BATEMAN (V.O.)
I'm trying to listen to the new George
Michael tape but Evelyn-my supposed fiancée-keeps buzzing
in my ear.
Evelyn continues to make notes.
EVELYN
Marzipan. Pink tents. Hundreds, thousands of roses.
Photographers. Annie Leibovitz. We'll get Annie Leibovitz.
And we'll hire someone to videotape. Patrick, we should do it.
BATEMAN
(Removing his Walkman)
Do...what.
EVELYN
Get married. Have a wedding.
BATEMAN
Evelyn?
EVELYN
Yes, darling?
BATEMAN
Is your Evian spiked?
EVELYN
We should do it.
BATEMAN
No-I can't take the time off work.
EVELYN
Your father practically owns the company. You can do
anything you like, silly.
BATEMAN
I don't want to talk about it.
EVELYN
Well, you hate that job anyway. Why don't you just
quit? You don't have to work.
BATEMAN
Because I...want...to...fit...in.
The taxi bumps to a halt.
INT. ESPACE RESTAURANT- NIGHT
A cavernous garage, harshly spot-lit, decorated in
self-conscious brutalist chic. Iron girders, walls of waxed
plaster featuring exposed rusted pipes, a huge Schnabel
smashed-plate painting on one wall. The tables and chairs are
made of extremely uncomfortable
bolted steel.
BATEMAN (V.O.)
I'm on the verge of tears by the time we arrive at Espace
since I'm positive we won't have a decent table, but we do,
and relief washes over me in an awesome wave.
Tm Price and two downtown types, STASH and VANDEN, are
already seated. Vanden is about twenty, pretty and sullen,
with green streaks in her black hair. Stash is pale, with
ragged black hair and bad skin.
They are all trying to read large stainless steel menus
that look like minimalist art.
PRICE
The menu's in braille.
He gets up to greet them, giving Evelyn a suspiciously long
kiss.
PRICE
I have to talk to you.
He drags her away, half giggling and protesting.
EVELYN
(Over her shoulder)
Pat, this is my cousin Vanden
and her boyfriend Stash. He's an artist.
BATEMAN
(After smiling at his own reflection in the mirror and
checking his hair)
Hi. Pat Bateman.
Vanden takes his hand reluctantly, says nothing.
BATEMAN
Let me guess-you live in the East Village?
Pause.
STASH
SoHo.
COURTNEY RAWLINSON and LUIS CARRUTHERS arrive at the table.
Courtney is blonde, classically beautiful and from
precisely the same social background as Evelyn, but she is
considerably more fragile and neurotic. Luis is
half-English, half-Argentinean, slightly overweight (a
rarity in this crowd), puppyish and eager to please. He
wears the same type of designer clothes as Price and
Bateman, but with foppish tendencies: velvet jackets,
bow-ties, boldly patterned vests.
They exchange air kisses. As soon as Luis turns his back,
Bateman sneaks a kiss on Courtney's neck.
COURTNEY
(Whispering)
Stop it!
Stash and Vanden watch them in silence.
LATER:
Price is whispering in Evelyn's ear. Everyone else is
quietly eating, except Bateman, who is drinking and watching
Evelyn and Price.
BATEMAN (V.O.)
I am fairly sure that Timothy and Evelyn
are having an affair. Timothy is the only interesting
person I know. Courtney is almost perfect looking. She s
usually operating on one or more psychiatric drugs. Tonight
I believe it's Xanax. More disturbing than her drug use,
though, is the fact that she's engaged to Luis Carruthers,
the biggest dufus in the business.
Courtney rouses herself from her drug haze.
COURTNEY
Tell me. Stash...do you think SoHo is
becoming to...commercial?
CARRUTHERS
Yes, I read that.
PRICE
Oh, who gives a rat's ass?
VANDEN
Hey. That affects us.
PRICE
(Wired on coke)
Oh ho ho. That affects us? What
about the massacres in Sri Lanka, honey? Doesn't that
affect us, too? I mean don't you know anything about Sri
Lanka? About how the Sikhs are killing like tons of
Israelis there? Doesn't that affect us?
BATEMAN
Oh come on. Price. There are a lot more important
problems than Sri Lanka to worry about. Sure our foreign
policy is important, but there are more pressing problems
at hand.
PRICE
Like what?
BATEMAN
Well, we have to end apartheid for one. And slow
down the nuclear arms race, stop terrorism and world
hunger. But we can't ignore our social needs. either We
have to stop people from abusing the welfare system. We
have to provide food and shelter for the homeless and
oppose racial discrimination and promote civil rights while
also promoting equal rights for women but change the
abortion laws to protect the right to life yet still
somehow maintain women's freedom of choice.
The table stares at Bateman uncomfortably.
BATEMAN
We also have to control the influx of illegal
immigrants. We have to encourage a return to traditional
moral values and curb graphic sex and violence on TV, in
movies, in pop music, everywhere. Most importantly we have
to promote general social concern and less materialism in
young people.
Price chokes on his drink. Everyone is silent and
mystified.
CARRUTHERS
Patrick, how thought-provoking.
INT. EVELYN'S BEDROOM - LATER THE SAME EVENING
Bateman and Evelyn are lying on her bed watching television.
BATEMAN
Why don t you just go for Price?
EVELYN
Oh God, Patrick. Why Price? Price?
BATEMAN
He's rich.
EVELYN
Everybody's rich.
BATEMAN
He's good-looking.
EVELYN
Everybody's good-looking, Patrick.
BATEMAN
He has a great body
EVELYN
Everybody has a great body now.
Bateman unbuttons his shirt and makes advances to get
Evelyn to have sex with him. She ignores him, watching the
Home Shopping Channel with the remote in her hand. Finally,
he straddles her, penis close to her face. She tries to
look around him at the TV, then takes notice.
EVELYN
What do you want to do with that, floss with it?
Bateman flops back down beside her and stares at the television.
EVELYN
Are you using minoxidil?
BATEMAN
No. I'm not. Why should I ?
EVELYN
Your hairline looks like it's receding.
BATEMAN
It's not.
EXT. STREET - LATER THAT NIGHT
It is 3 a.m. Bateman is standing at an ATM, listening to the
comforting sound of fresh bills thudding out of the machine.
Bateman turns around and watches a solitary young woman walk
past him. He collects his money, placing it carefully in his
wallet, and then walks toward her, whistling. He catches up
to her as she pauses at a red light.
BATEMAN
Hello.
The woman looks suspicious for a moment and then, seeing
his smile, smiles back.
INT. DRY CLEANERS - DAY
Bateman, dressed in an Armani suit
with an unlit cigar between his teeth is standing in a dry
cleaners, arguing with the Chinese woman behind the
counter.
BATEMAN
Listen, wait. You're not...shhh wait...
you're not giving me valid reasons.
The woman continues to speak to him in another language,
grabbing at the sleeve of the jacket.
BATEMAN
What are you trying to say to me?
Her husband has taken Bateman's horribly bloodstained
sheets out of the bag and is staring at them.
BATEMAN
Bleach-ee? Are you trying to say bleach-ee?
Bleach-ee. Oh my God.
She keeps pointing to the jacket and talking.
BATEMAN
(Talking over her)
Two things. One. You can't bleach a Soprani. Out of the question.
Two.
(Louder)
Two. I can only get these sheets in Santa Fe. These are very
expensive sheets and I really need them clean.
She keeps talking and Bateman leans into her.
BATEMAN
If you don't shut your fucking mouth I will kill
you, are you understanding me?
She talks faster.
BATEMAN
Now listen-I have a very important lunch meeting
(Checks Rolex)
at Hubert's in thirty minutes, and I need those
...no wait, twenty minutes. I have a lunch meeting at
Hubert's in twenty minutes with Ronald Harrison and I need
those sheets cleaned by this afternoon.
She keeps talking.
BATEMAN Listen. I cannot understand you.
Bateman starts laughing, slaps his hand down on the
counter.
BATEMAN
This is crazy. You're a fool. I can't cope with
this.
Bateman is on the verge of tears.
BATEMAN
Stupid bitchee! Understand? Oh Christ!
Someone enters the store behind him. It's VICTORIA,
late-twenties, attractive but a little overweight, wearing a
tailored business suit with white sneakers and sports socks.
VICTORIA
Patrick?
She takes off her sunglasses.
VICTORIA
Hi, Patrick. I thought that was you.
BATEMAN
Hello
(Mumbles un incomprehensible name)
Awkward pause.
BATEMAN
Well.
VICTORIA
Isn't it ridiculous? Coming all the way up here,
but you
know. They really are the best.
BATEMAN
Then why can't they get these stains out? I mean can you talk
to these people or something? I'm not getting anywhere.
Victoria moves toward the sheet that the old man is holding
up. She
touches it and the woman behind the counter begins talking
again.
VICTORIA
Oh my, I see. What are those? Oh my.
BATEMAN
Um, well...it s cranberry juice. Cranapple.
VICTORiA
(Skeptically) Really?
BATEMAN
Well, I mean, um, it s really...Bosco. You
know, like...
like a Dove Bar. It's a Dove Bar...Hershey's Syrup?
VICTORIA
(As if sharing a secret joke) Oh yeah. Oh I get it.
Fun with chocolate.
BATEMAN
Listen, if you could talk to them
(He yanks the sheet out of the man's hand)
I would really appreciate it. I'm really late. I have a
lunch appointment at Hubert's in fifteen minutes.
Bateman turns to leave.
VICTORIA
Hubert's? Oh really? It moved uptown, right?
BATEMAN
Yeah, well, oh boy, listen, I've got to go. Thank
you, uh...
Victoria?
VICTORIA
Maybe we could have lunch one day next week? You
know, I'm downtown near Wall Street quite often.
BATEMAN
Oh, I don't know, Victoria. I'm at work all the
time.
VICTORIA
Well, what about, oh, you know, maybe a Saturday?
BATEMAN
(Checking his watch)
Next Saturday?
VICTORIA
(Shrugging)
Yeah.
BATEMAN
Oh, can't, I'm afraid. Matinée of Les Miserables.
Listen, I've really got to go. I'll-Oh...Christ...I'll call
you.
VICTORIA
Okay. Do.
Bateman glares at the woman behind the counter and rushes
out the door. Victoria stares after him as we hear the sound
of the bell on the closing door.
INT. BATEMAN'S APARTMENT - DAY
Bateman is sitting on the sofa watching a video, talking to
Courtney on a portable phone. He's holding a video box in one
hand, perusing the title: Inside Lydia's Ass. Offscreen we hear
the sounds of the porn movie as he talks.
BATEMAN
Listen, what are you doing tonight?
COURTNEY
What? Oh, I'm...busy.
BATEMAN
Listen, you're dating Luis, he's in Arizona. You're fucking me,
and we haven't made plans. What could you possibly be up to
tonight?
COURTNEY
Stop it. I'm...
BATEMAN
On a lot of lithium?
COURTNEY
Waiting for Luis to call me. He said he'd call
tonight. Oh don't be difficult, Patrick.
BATEMAN
You should come have dinner with me.
COURTNEY
But-when?
BATEMAN
Am I confused or were we talking about tonight?
COURTNEY
Ummm . . yeah. Luis is calling me tonight. I
need to be
home for that.
BATEMAN
Pumpkin?
COURTNEY
Yes?
BATEMAN
Pumpkin you're dating an asshole.
COURTNEY
Uh huh.
BATEMAN
Pumpkin you're dating the biggest dickweed in New
York.
COURTNEY
I know. Stop it.
BATEMAN
Pumpkin, you're dating a tumbling, tumbling
dickweed.
COURTNEY
Patrick don't call me pumpkin anymore, okay? I have to go.
BATEMAN
Courtney? Dinner?
COURTNEY
I can't.
BATEMAN
I'm thinking Dorsia.
COURTNEY
Dorsia's nice.
BATEMAN
Nice?
COURTNEY
You like it there, don't you?
BATEMAN
The question is do you like it, Courtney? And will
you blow off a fucking phone call from your sad excuse for a
boyfriend to eat there tonight.
COURTNEY
Okay. Yeah. What time?
BATEMAN
Eight?
COURTNEY
Pick me up?
BATEMAN
Sounds like I'll have to. Don't fall asleep, okay? Wear
something fabulous. Dorsia, remember?
Bateman hangs up, opens up the Zagat's guide and dials the
number for Dorsia with trembling fingers. It's busy and so
he puts it on speakerphone, constant redial. He waits with
his head in his hands, sweating with anxiety, until there
is finally an answer.
MAITRE D'
Dorsia. Please hold.
He is on hold for a long time, getting very tense.
MAITRE D'
Dorsia.
BATEMAN
(Both of his eyes are closed)
Umm...yes...I know it's a little late but is it possible to
reserve a table for two at eight or eight-thirty perhaps?
Long pause. The Maitre D' starts giggling quietly and then
more loudly until the laughter is almost hysterical and he
hangs up the phone.
INT. TAXI- NIGHT
Bateman and Courtney are in the back of a cab. Courtney is
heavily medicated.
COURTNEY
A facial at Elizabeth Arden, which was really
relaxing, then to the Pottery Bam where I bought this
silver muffin dish.
(She starts to pass out)
BATEMAN
Is that Donald Trump's car?
COURTNEY
(Thickly)
Oh God, Patrick. Shut up.
BATEMAN
You know, Courtney, you should take some more
lithium. Or have a Diet Coke. Some caffeine might get you
out of this slump.
COURTNEY
I just want to have a child. Just...two...
perfect...children...
(Her voice trails as she descends back into a drug haze)
The cab draws up outside a restaurant. The awning reads
""Barcadia.""
INT. BARCADIA - NIGHT
An insanely expensive nouvelle Italian restaurant all
polished natural brick, spotless white tablecloths,
minimalist flower arrangements, discreet lighting.
A waiter has come to take their drink orders.
BATEMAN
J&B. Straight.
COURTNEY
Champagne on the rocks. Oh-could I have that with
a twist? She starts to sink back in her chair and Bateman
leans over and pulls her back up.
COURTNEY
Are we here?
BATEMAN
Yes.
COURTNEY
This is Dorsia?
BATEMAN
(Examining a menu that says ""Barcadia"" in large script)
Yes, dear.
Courtney almost falls asleep while looking at her menu, and
starts to slide off of her chair. Bateman grabs her by both
shoulders and props her up.
BATEMAN
Courtney, you're going to have the peanut butter
soup with smoked duck and mashed squash. New York magazine
called it a 'playful but mysterious little dish."" You'll
love it. And then...the red snapper with violets and
pine nuts. I think that'll follow nicely.
COURTNEY
Mmmm...thanks, Patrick.
She falls asleep at the table.
INT. COURTNEY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Bateman and Courtney are in Courtney's bed. Bateman is on
top of her, reaching for a condom in the ashtray. He tears
it open with his teeth, puts it on.
COURTNEY
(Dazed on lithium)
I want you to fuck me.
Bateman gets on top of her, starts to fuck her.
COURTNEY
Luis is a despicable twit.
BATEMAN
Yes, Luis is a despicable twit. I hate him.
He keeps fucking her.
COURTNEY
No, you idiot. I said ""Is it a receptacle tip?""
Not, is Luis a despicable twit. Is it a receptacle tip?
Get off me.
BATEMAN
Is it a what?
COURTNEY
Pull out.
BATEMAN
I'm ignoring you.
COURTNEY
(screaming)
Pull out, goddamnit!
BATEMAN
(Slowing down but not stopping)
What do you want, Courtney?
She pushes him away from her.
BATEMAN
It's a plain end. I think.
COURTNEY
Turn the light on.
She tries to sit up.
BATEMAN
Oh Jesus. I'm going home.
COURTNEY
Patrick. Turn on the Light.
He turns on the light.
BATEMAN
It's a plain end, see? So?
COURTNEY
Take it off.
BATEMAN
Why?
COURTNEY
Because you have to leave half an inch at the tip –
(She covers herself with her comforter)
to catch the force of the ejaculate!
BATEMAN
I'm getting out of here. Where's your lithium?
Courtney throws a pillow over her head and starts crying.
COURTNEY
(Screaming)
Do you think you're turning me on by having unsafe sex?
Bateman pulls the pillow off her and slaps her face.
BATEMAN
Oh Christ, this really isn't worth it. And see,
Courtney, it's there for what? Huh? Tell us.
(He slaps her again lightly)
Why is it pulled down half an inch?
So it can catch the force of the ejaculate!
COURTNEY
(Choking crying)
Well, it's not a turn-on for me.
I have a promotion coming to me. I don't want to get AIDS.
Bateman grabs her head and makes her look at the condom.
BATEMAN
See? Happy? You dumb bitch? Are you happy, you dumb bitch?
COURTNEY
Oh God, just get it over with.
He fucks her quickly until he has a mediocre orgasm and
falls down next to her. They lie side by side with their
bodies not touching, eyes open, staring at the
ceiling.
INT. CONFERENCE ROOM, PIERCE & PIERCE - DAY
Bateman and Luis Carruthers are seated at a long table in
the conference room at Pierce & Pierce, which looks out onto
a spectacular view of Manhattan.
CARRUTHERS
Patrick, thanks so much for looking after Courtney.
Dorsia, how impressive! How on earth did you get a
reservation there?
BATEMAN
Lucky, I guess.
CARRUTHERS
That's a wonderful jacket. Let me guess,
Valentino Couture?
BATEMAN
Uh huh.
CARRUTHERS
(Reaching out to touch it)
It looks so soft.
BATEMAN
(Catching Luis hand)
Your compliment was sufficient Luis.
Carruthers is distracted by a question from the colleague
on his left.Paul Owen enters, carrying the Wall St. Journal
under his arm. He is handsome, supremely confident and
self-satisfied; he sees himself as a leader among men.
OWEN
(To Bateman)
Hello, Halberstam. Nice tie. How the hell are you?
BATEMAN
I've been great. And you?
Their conversation fades down as we hear Bateman's
thoughts.
BATEMAN (V.O.)
Owen has mistaken me for this dickhead Marcus Halberstam.
It seems logical because Marcus also works at P&P and in
fact does the same exact thing I do and he also has a
penchant for Valentino suits and Oliver Peoples glasses.
Marcus and I even go to the same barber, although I have
a slightly better haircut.
During this voiceover the CAMERA WANDERS over to MARCUS
HALBERSTAM, who is conferring with a colleague in the
opposite corner of the room. He bears a
superficial resemblance to Bateman.
OWEN
How's the Ransom account going, Marcus?
BATEMAN
(Nervous)
It's...it's...all right.
OWEN
Really? That's interesting.
(He stares at Bateman, smiling)
Not great?
BATEMAN
Oh well, you know.
OWEN
And how's Cecilia? She's a great girl.
BATEMAN
Oh yes. I'm very lucky.
McDermott and Price enter.
McDERMOTT
Hey. Owen! Congratulations on the Fisher account.
OWEN
Thank you, Baxter.
PRICE
Listen, Paul. Squash?
OWEN
Call me.
(Hands him a business card)
PRICE
How about Friday?
OWEN
No can do. Got a res at eight-thirty at Dorsia. Great sea
urchin ceviche. There is a stunned silence as he walks away
and sits in a corner of the room, ostentatiously studying papers.
CLOSE-UP on Bateman's face, cold with hatred.
PRICE
(Whispering)
Jesus. Dorsia? On a Friday night? How'd he swing that?
McDERMOTT (Whispering)
I think he's lying.
Bateman takes out his wallet and pulls out a card.
PRICE
(Suddenly enthused)
What's that, a gram?
BATEMAN
New card. What do you think?
McDermott lifts it up and examines the lettering carefully.
McDERMOTT
Whoa. Very nice. Take a look.
He hands it to Van Patten.
BATEMAN
Picked them up from the printers yesterday
VAN PATTEN
Good coloring.
BATEMAN
That's bone. And the lettering is something called
Silian Rail.
McDERMOTT
(Envious)
Silian Rail?
VAN PATTEN
It is very cool, Bateman. But that's nothing.
He pulls a card out of his wallet and slaps it on the
table.
VAN PATTEN
Look at this.
They all lean forward to inspect it.
PRICE
That's really nice.
Bateman clenches his fists beneath the table, trying to
control his anxiety.
VAN PATTEN
Eggshell with Romalian type.
(Turning to Bateman)
What do you think?
BATEMAN
(Barely able to breath, his voice a croak)
Nice.
PRICE
(Holding the card up to the light)
Jesus. This is really super. How'd a nitwit like you get so
tasteful?
Bateman stares at his own card and then enviously at
McDermott's.
BATEMAN (V.O.)
I can't believe that Price prefers McDermott's card to mine.
PRICE
But wait. You ain't seen nothin' yet.
He holds up his own card.
PRICE
Raised lettering, pale nimbus white...
BATEMAN
(Choking with anxiety)
Impressive. Very nice. Let's see Paul Owen's card.
Price pulls a card from an inside coat pocket and holds it
up for their inspection: ""PAUL OWEN, PIERCE & PIERCE,
MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS."" Bateman swallows, speechless.
The sound in the room dies down and all we hear is a faint
heartbeat as Bateman stares at the magnificent card.
BATEMAN (V.O.)
Look at that subtle off-white coloring. The tasteful thickness
of it. Oh my God, it even has a watermark...
His hand shaking, Bateman lifts up the card and stares at it
until it fills the screen.
He lets it fall. The SOUND RETURNS TO NORMAL.
CARRUTHERS Is something wrong? Patrick...you're sweating.
EXT. STREET- EVENING
The financial district. The streets are eerily deserted.
Bateman stands at an ATM, enjoying the reassuring sound of
$500 in fresh bills thudding from the machine. As he turns
to leave, he notices someone across the street.
A HOMELESS MAN is lying in a doorway on top of an open
grate, surrounded by bags of garbage and a shopping cart. A
cardboard sign is attached to the front of the cart: I AM
HOMELESS AND HUNGRY PLEASE HELP ME. A small, thin dog lies
next to him.
He is black, dressed in a stained, torn, lime-green
polyester pants suit with jeans worn over the pants.
BATEMAN
(Offering his hand) Hello. Pat Bateman.
The Homeless Man stares at Bateman, struggling to sit up.
BATEMAN
You want some money?. Some...food?
The Homeless Man nods and starts to cry. Bateman reaches
into his pocket and pulls out a $I 0 bill, then changes his
mind and holds out a $5 instead.
BATEMAN
Is this what you need?
The Homeless Man nods, looks away, wipes his nose.
HOMELESS MAN
I'm so hungry.
BATEMAN
It's cold out, too, isn't it?
HOMELESS MAN
I'm so hungry.
BATEMAN
(Holding the bill just out of the man's reach)
Why don't you get a job? If you're so hungry, why don't you
get a job?
HOMELESS MAN
(Shivering and sobbing)
I lost my job...
BATEMAN
Why? Were you drinking? Is that why you lost it?
Insider trading? Just joking. No, really-were you drinking on
the job?
HOMELESS MAN I was fired. I was laid off.
BATEMAN
Gee, uh, that's too bad.
HOMELESS MAN
I'm so hungry.
The dog starts to whimper.
BATEMAN
Why don't you get another one? Why don't , you get another job?
HOMELESS MAN
I'm not...
BATEMAN
You're not what? Qualified for anything else?
HOMELESS MAN
I'm hungry
BATEMAN
I know that, I know that. Jeez, you're like a broken record.
I'm trying to help you.
HOMELESS MAN
I'm hungry.
BATEMAN
Listen, do you think it's fair to take money from people who
do have jobs? From people who do work?
HOMELESS MAN
What am I gonna do?
BATEMAN
Listen, what's your name?
HOMELESS MAN
Al.
BATEMAN
Speak up. Come on.
HOMELESS MAN
Al.
BATEMAN
Get a goddamn job, Al. You've got a negative attitude.
That's what's stopping you. You've got to get your act together.
I'll help you.
HOMELESS MAN
You re so kind, mister. You're kind. You're a kind
man. I can tell.
BATEMAN
(Petting the dog)
Shhhh...it's okay.
HOMELESS MAN
(Grabbing Bateman's wrist)
Please...I don know what to do. I'm so cold.
BATEMAN
(Stroking his face, whispering)
Do ,you know how bad you smell? The stench, my God.
HOMELESS MAN
I can't...I can't find a shelter
BATEMAN
You reek. You reek of...shit. Do you know that?
(Shouting)
Goddammit, Al-look at me and stop crying like some kind of
faggot. Al...I'm sorry.
Bateman carefully puts the money back in his wallet.
BATEMAN
It's just that...I don't know I don't have anything in common
with you.
He opens his briefcase and pulls out a long thin knife with
a serrated edge. He pushes up the sleeve of his jacket to
protect it.
BATEMAN
Do you know what a fucking loser ,you are?
HOMELESS MAN'S POV as Bateman lunges at him with the knife.
EXTREME WIDE SHOT of the street. Bateman's shadowed figure
is hunched over the Homeless Man, stabbing him in the stomach.
The dog barks wildly and Bateman stomps on it until it is
silent.
LOW ANGLE shot of Bateman as he throws a quarter on the ground.
BATEMAN
There's a quarter. Go buy some gum.
Bateman walks calmly into the empty caverns of Wall Street.
Cars drift past, their headlights momentarily illuminating the
body left twitching on the ground.
INT. BEAUTY SALON - DAY
CLOSE-UP on Bateman's face and torso. His eyes are closed as a
woman's hands rub cream into his face.
FACIALIST
What beautiful skin you have, Mr Bateman. So
fine, so smooth...
His eyes open to look up at the facialist and then he
closes them again.
BATEMAN (V.O.)
I have all the characteristics of a human being- flesh, blood,
skin, hair-but not a single clear, identifiable emotion except
for greed ,und disgust. Something horrible is happening inside
me and I don't know why.
CUT TO:
Bateman sitting in a chair, looking down at the
MANICURIST who is giving him a pedicure. She is cutting his
nails with tiny sharp scissors. He stares at them longingly.
BATEMAN (V.O.)
My nightly bloodlust has overflowed into my days. I feel lethal,
on the verge of frenzy.
CUT TO:
Bateman lying irradiated by ultraviolet light on a tanning
bed, wearing goggles.
BATEMAN (V.O.)
I think my mask of sanity is about to slip.
INT. TEXARKANA RESTAURANT - NIGHT
An insanely expensive nouvelle Tex-Mex restaurant, with an
ironic Southwestern decor: Santa Fe colors, Navajo blankets,
naive cowboy art, rawhide banquettes.
Bateman bursts in the door, late, and approaches the MAITRE D'.
BATEMAN
Marcus Halberstam. For two at eight?
MAITRE D'
Your friend has already been seated. Follow me, Mr. Halberstam.
Paul Owen is seated at a table underneath an enormous pair of
ram's horns. He is arguing with the WAITER.
OWEN
No, I want to know. I came here for the cilantro
crawfish gumbo, which is after all the only excuse one
could have for being in this restaurant, which is by the
way, almost completely empty. Am I to believe that all ten
people in this restaurant have eaten your entire supply of
cilantro crawfish gumbo?
WAITER
I'm very sorry sir. There was a fire in the kitchen
earlier today, and-
BATEMAN
J&B, straight. And a Dixie beer.
WAITER
Would you like to hear-
OWEN
Double Absolut martini.
WAITER
Yes, sir. Would you like to hear the specials?
BATEMAN
Not if you want to keep your spleen.
The Waiter leaves.
OWEN
This is a real beehive of, uh, activity, Halberstam.
This place is hot, very hot.
BATEMAN
Listen, the mud soup and the charcoal arugula are outrageous
here.
OWEN
Yeah, well, you're late.
BATEMAN
Hey, I'm a child of divorce. Give me a break
(Studying the menu; he's in a surprisingly good mood)
Hmmm, I see they've omitted the pork loin with lime jello.
OWEN
We should've gone to Dorsia. I could've gotten us a table.
BATEMAN
Nobody goes there anymore.
There is a long disgruntled silence.
BATEMAN
Is that Ivana Trump over there? (Laughs) Jeez
Patrick I mean Marcus, what are you thinking? Why would Ivana
be at Texarkana?
Another pause.
BATEMAN
So, wasn't Rothschild originally handling the
Fisher account? How did you get it?
OWEN
I could tell you that, Halberstam, but then I'd have
to kill you.
He guffaws. Bateman laughs politely.
LATER:
Paul Owen is very drunk. BATEMAN cold sober.
BATEMAN
I like to dissect girls. Did you know I'm utterly insane?
Owen continues laughing and motions to the waiter for another
drink.
OWEN
Great tan, Marcus. Really impressive. Where do you tan?
BATEMAN Salon.
OWEN
I've got a tanning bed at home. You should look into it.
Bateman nods, agitated.
OWEN
And Cecelia, how is she? Where is she tonight?
BATEMAN
Cecelia is, well...you know (Cecelia. I think
she's having dinner with...Evelyn Williams.
OWEN
Evelyn. Great ass. Goes out with that loser Patrick
Bateman. What a dork.
BATEMAN
Another Martini, Paul?
Owen nods drunkenly.
LATER:
The end of the meal. Owen is squeezing a lime onto the
table, missing his beer, incredibly drunk. The check is laid
down.
BATEMAN
(Talking to Owen like a child)
Paul, give me your Amex card. Good boy.
Bateman slaps the card down, looks at the check.
BATEMAN
Two-hundred-and-fifty. Very reasonable. Let's leave
a big tip, shall we? My place hr a nightcap?
OWEN
No, man. I'm gonna bail.
BATEMAN
Come on, you dumb son of a bitch.
(Helping him into his jacket)
I've got a preview of the Barneys catalogue and a
bottle of Absolut waiting for us.
INT. BATEMAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
The living room floor has been meticulously covered with
newspaper.
Owen is slumped drunkenly in a white Eames chair, a glass
in his hand. Bateman is looking through his CDs.
BATEMAN
You like Huey Lewis and the News?
OWEN
They're okay.
BATEMAN
Their early work was a little too New Wave for my
taste. But then Sports came out in 1983, I think they really
came into their own, commercially and artistically.
Bateman walks to his bathroom, taking a large ax out of the
shower. He takes two Valium.
BATEMAN
(Said partly from the bathroom)
The whole album has a clear, crisp sound and a new sheen of
consummate professionalism that gives the songs a big boost.
Bateman comes back out and leans the ax against the wall.
He walks to the foyer and puts on a raincoat, watching Owen
from behind ail the time.
BATEMAN
He's been compared to ELvis Costello but I think
Huey has a more bitter, cynical sense of humor.
Owen is absent-mindedly leafing through the Barneys
catalogue.
OWEN
Hey, Halberstam?
BATEMAN
Yes, Owen?
OWEN
Why are there copies of the Style section all over
the place? Do you have a dog? A chow or something?
BATEMAN
No, Owen.
OWEN
(Confused)
Is that a raincoat?
BATEMAN
Yes, it is.
Bateman moves to the CD player. He takes a CD out of its
case and slides it in the machine.
BATEMAN
In 1987 Huey released this, Fore!, their most
accomplished album. I think I heir undisputed masterpiece is
""HiP To Be Square,"" a song so catchy that most people probably
don't listen to the lyrics. But they should because it's not
just about the pleasures of conformity and the importance of
trends. It's al~ a personal statement about the band itself.
Bateman puts on ""Hip To Be Square.""
BATEMAN crosses the room and picks up the ax.
We follow BATEMAN from behind as he walks up to Owen, the
ax raised over his head.
BATEMAN
Hey, Paul?
As Owen turns around, FROM OWEN'S POV we see Bateman swing
the ax toward his face.
Blood sprays onto the white raincoat.
FROM BEHIND OWEN, we see BATEMAN as he yanks the ax out.
Owen drops to the floor. His body falls out of the frame.
We stay on his legs twitching mechanically.
Blood pulses onto the newspaper-covered floor.
BATEMAN
(Raising the ax and screaming)
Try getting a reservation at Dorsia now, you fucking
stupid bastard!
LOW ANGLE ON BATEMAN as he beats Owen with the back of the
ax.
OFFSCREEN, the sound of the ax hitting Owen.
BATEMAN
(Panting)
Fucking bastard...
Bateman takes his raincoat off, still panting. He folds the
coat carefully in half, bloody side in, and drapes it neatly
over the back of a chair.
He sits back on the white sofa and surveys the scene. He
checks his Rolex and lights a cigar.
OFFSCREEN, Paul Owen's last faint sighs are heard.
INT. LOBBY - NIGHT
BATEMAN drags a large, blood-soaked sleeping bag through the lobby,
past the bored doorman, who looks up from the Post for a moment.
EXT. STREET - NIGHT
BATEMAN is trying to hail a cab. Owen's body is at his
feet. Luis Carruthers and a Japanese girl walk up to him.
CARRUTHERS
Patrick? Is that you?
BATEMAN
No, Luis. It's not me. You're mistaken.
CARRUTHERS
This is Gwendolyn Ichiban. This is my very good
friend Patrick Bateman. Where are you going? We're going to
Nell's. Gwendolyn's father's buying it.
(Looking down at the body)
Where did you get your overnight bag?
BATEMAN
Commes des Garcon.
A cab stops. BATEMAN opens the door and manages to get
Owen's body into the backseat.
Bateman gets into the cab.
CARRUTHERS
Call me please, Patrick.
BATEMAN
Jesus lives, Luis.
INT. BATEMAN'S HELL'S KITCHEN APARTMENT - NIGHT
A bare room, lit by one light bulb. The walls are blank
except for a Les Miserables poster. There is one ratty chair.
Bateman pours lime over Paul Owen's body, which is lying in
a bathtub. He plays Huey Lewis, smokes a cigar, watches the
body dissolve.
INT. PAUL OWEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Bateman is letting himself into the apartment. It is very
similar to Bateman's, but even more minimalist. The walls
are white-pigmented concrete with a large minimalist painting
on the wall. One wall is covered in a trendy, large-scale
scientific drawing above a long, black leather couch.
BATEMAN
Where to send the bastard? Dallas? Pans?
He throws some clothes into a suitcase, randomly grabbing
toiletries and shoving them in.
BATEMAN
Singapore? London. I'll send the asshole to London.
He puts some music on to help muffle his voice, then leans
over the answering machine.
He does a passable imitation of Owen's speech.
BATEMAN
Hi, this is Paul. I've been called away to London
for a few days. Meredith, I'll call you when I get back.
Hasta la vista, baby.
INT. BATEMAN'S OFFICE - MORNING
Bateman is sitting at his desk, with the latest copy of
Sports Illustrated in front of him and his Walkman playing
Kenny G. We hear the MUSIC until Jean enters and he takes
the Walkman off.
BATEMAN
(Faintly irritable)
What is it?
JEAN
Patrick?
BATEMAN
(Condescendingly)
Ye-es, Je-an?
JEAN
Patrick, a Mr. Donald KIMBALL is here to see you.
BATEMAN
Who?
JEAN
Detective Donald KIMBALL?
Silence. Bateman stares out the window, then down at the
drawing of a headless woman he's been doodling on the back
cover of Sports Illustrated.
BATEMAN
Tell him I'm at lunch.
JEAN
(whispering)
Patrick, I think he knows you're here.
It's only ten-thirty.
Silence.
BATEMAN
Send him in, I guess. As she exits, he picks up the cordless
phone and pretends to talk to someone at the other end.
BATEMAN
Now, John, you've got to wear clothes in proportion
to your physique. There are definite do's and don'ts, good
buddy, of wearing a bold-striped shirt. A hold-striped shirt
calls for solid-colored or discreetly patterned suits and ties...
The door to the office opens and he waves in DETECTIVE DONALD
KIMBALL. KIMBALL is surprisingly young - about Bateman's age -
and good-looking, dressed in a crumpled linen Armani suit of
the type Bateman and his friends might wear.
Kimball sits down and crosses his legs with a
self-assurance that makes Bateman so nervous he forgets to
carry on with his fake conversation. Kimball looks up at
him curiously, noticing the silence.
BATEMAN
(Realizing that Kimball is staring at him)
Right. And yes...always tip the stylist fifteen percent.
Bateman shrugs at the detective, rolling his eyes in
exasperation.
KIMBALL nods understandingly.
BATEMAN
Listen, John, I've got to go. T Boone Pickens just
walked in...
(He laughs inanely)
Just joking...
(Pause)
No don't tip the owner of the salon. Okay, John,
right, got it.
(He hangs up the phone and pushes the antenna in)
Sorry about that.
KIMBALL
No, I'm sorry. I should've made an appointment.
(Gesturing toward the phone)
Was that anything important?
BATEMAN
Oh that? Just mulling over business problems.
Examining opportunities...Exchanging rumors...
Spreading gossip.
They laugh politely.
KIMBALL
(Holding out his hand)
Hi. I'm Donald KIMBALL
BATEMAN
(Shaking firmly)
Hi. Pat Bateman. Nice to meet you.
KIMBALL
I'm sorry to barge in on you like this. but I was supposed
to talk to Luis Carruthers and he wasn't in and...well,
you're here, so...I know how busy you guys can get.
KIMBALL stares at the three open copies of Sports
Illustrated and the Sony Walkman lying on Bateman's desk.
Bateman sees the look and sweeps the magazines
into the top drawer along with the Walkman, which is
still running.
BATEMAN
(Forcing himself to sound friendly and relaxed)
So, what's the topic of discussion?
KIMBALL
I've been hired by Meredith Powell to investigate
the disappearance of Paul Owen.
BATEMAN
You're not with the FBI or anything, are you?
KIMBALL
Nothing like that. I'm just a private investigator.
BATEMAN
Ah, I see...Yes. Paul's disappearance...Yes.
KIMBALL
So it's nothing that official. I just have some
basic questions. About Paul Owen. About yourself-
BATEMAN
Coffee?
KIMBALL
No. I'm okay.
BATEMAN
Perrier? San Pellegrino?
KIMBALL
No, I'm okay.
KIMBALL takes out a small black notepad and the same gold
Cross pen that Bateman and his friends all use. Bateman buzzes
Jean.
JEAN (O.S.)
Patrick?
BATEMAN
Can you bring Mr...
KIMBALL
KIMBALL.
BATEMAN
Mr. Kimball a bottle of San Pelle-
KIMBALL
Oh no, I'm okay.
BATEMAN
It's no problem
Bateman watches intently as KIMBALL writes something down
in his notebook, then crosses something out. Jean enters
and places the bottle of San Pellegrino and a Steuben etched
glass on the table, shooting a concerned glance at Bateman.
He glares at her. KIMBALL smiles and nods at Jean as she leaves.
BATEMAN
Well, what's the topic of discussion?
KIMBALL
The disappearance of Paul Owen.
BATEMAN
Oh right. Well, I haven't heard anything about the
disappearance or anything...
(Trying to laugh)
Not on ""Page Six"" at least.
KIMBALL
I think his family wants this kept quiet.
BATEMAN
Understandable.
(Staring at the untouched bottle of San Pellegrino)
Lime?
KIMBALL
No, really. I'm okay.
BATEMAN
You sure? I can always get you a lime.
A pause.
KIMBALL
Just some preliminary questions that I need for my own
files, okay?
BATEMAN
Shoot.
KIMBALL
How old are you?
BATEMAN
Twenty-six. I'll be twenty-seven in October.
KIMBALL
(Scribbling in his notebook)
Where did you go to school?
BATEMAN
Harvard. The Harvard Business School.
KIMBALL
Your address?
BATEMAN
Fifty-five West Eighty-First Street. The American
Gardens Building.
KIMBALL
(Looking up, impressed)
Nice. Very nice.
BATEMAN
(Flattered)
Thanks.
A pause as KIMBALL studies his notebook. Bateman closes his
eyes, as if in pain.
KIMBALL
Pardon me, but are you okay?
BATEMAN
Who do you ask?
KIMBALL
You seem...nervous.
Bateman reaches into his desk drawer and brings out a
bottle of aspirin.
BATEMAN
Nuprin?
KIMBALL Uh...no, thanks.
Kimball takes out a pack of Marlboro's and lays it on the
desk.
BATEMAN
Bad habit.
KIMBALL
I know. I'm sorry.
A pause, as Bateman stares at the cigarettes.
KIMBALL
Would you rather I not smoke?
BATEMAN
No, I guess it's okay.
KIMBALL
You sure?
BATEMAN
No problem.
(Buzzing Jean)
JEAN (O.S.)
Yes, Patrick?
BATEMAN
Bring us an ashtray for Mr. KIMBALL, please.
She whisks in with a crystal ashtray as they sit in silence.
KIMBALL
What can you tell me about Paul Owen?
BATEMAN
Well...
He coughs, shakes two Nuprin into his hand and swallows
them dry.
KIMBALL
How well did you know him?
BATEMAN
I'm...at a loss. He was part of that whole...Yale thing,
you know.
KIMBALL
Yale thing?
A pause.
BATEMAN
Yeah...Yale thing.
KIMBALL
What do you mean...Yale thing?
A pause.
BATEMAN
Well, I think for one that he was probably a closet
homosexual. Who did a lot of cocaine...that Yale thing.
A silence during which the sound of the air conditioner
becomes deafening.
KIMBALL
So...there's nothing you can tell me about Paul
Owen?
BATEMAN
He led what I suppose was an orderly life. He...
ate a balanced diet.
KIMBALL
What kind of man was he? Besides...
(He hesitates tries to smile)
the information you've just given.
BATEMAN
I hope I'm not being cross-examined here.
KIMBALL
Do you feel that way?
BATEMAN
No. Not really.
KIMBALL
(As he writes without looking up)
Where did Paul hang out?
BATEMAN
Hang...out?
KIMBALL
Yeah. You know...hang out.
BATEMAN
Let me think. The Newport. Harry's. Fluties. Endochine.
Nell's. Comell Club. The New York Yacht Club. The regular
places.
KIMBALL
He had a yacht?
BATEMAN
No, he just hung out there.
KIMBALL
And where did he go to school?
A slight pause.
BATEMAN
Don't you know this?
KIMBALL
I just wanted to know if you know.
BATEMAN
Before Yale? If I remember correctly, Saint Paul's...
Listen, I just...I just want to help.
KIMBALL
I understand.
He makes another note.
KIMBALL
Anything else you can tell me about Owen?
BATEMAN
We were both seven in 1969.
KIMBALL
(Smiles)
So was I.
BATEMAN
Do you have any witnesses or fingerprints?
KIMBALL
Well, there's a message on his answering machine saying he
went to London.
BATEMAN
Well, maybe he did, huh?
KIMBALL
His girlfriend doesn't think so.
BATEMAN
But...has anyone seen him in London?
KIMBALL
Actually, yes.
BATEMAN
Hmmm.
KIMBALL
Well, I've had a hard time getting an actual verification.
A Stephen Hughes says he saw him at a restaurant there, but
I checked it out and what happened is, he mistook a Hubert
Ainsworth for Paul, so...
BATEMAN
Oh.
KIMBALL
Was he involved at all , do you think, in occultism or Satan
worship?
BATEMAN
What?
KIMBALL
I know it sounds like a lame question, but in New Jersey I
know this sounds like a lame question, but last month-I don't
know if you've heard about this, but a young stockbroker was
recently arrested and charged with murdering a young Chicano
girl and performing voodoo rituals with various body parts-
BATEMAN
Yikes! No. Paul wasn't into that. He followed a balanced
diet and-
KIMBALL
Yeah, I know, and was into that whole Yale thing.
A pause - the longest so far.
BATEMAN
Have you consulted a psychic?
KIMBALL
No.
BATEMAN
Had his apartment been burglarized?
KIMBALL
No, it actually hadn't. Toiletries were missing. A
suit was gone. So was some luggage. That's it.
BATEMAN
I mean no one's dealing with the homicide squad yet
or anything, right?
KIMBALL
No, not yet. As I said, we're not sure. But...
basically no one has seen or heard anything.
BATEMAN
That's so typical, isn't it?
KIMBALL
It's just strange.
(He stares out the window, lost in thought)
One day someone's walking around, going to work, alive,
and then...
BATEMAN
Nothing.
KIMBALL
People just...disappear.
BATEMAN
The earth just opens up and swallows people.
(He checks his Rolex)
KIMBALL
Eerie. Really eerie.
Silence.
BATEMAN
(Standing up)
You'll have to excuse me. I have a lunch meeting
with Cliff Huxtable at Four Seasons in twenty minutes.
KIMBALL
Isn't the Four Seasons a little far uptown? I
mean aren't you going to be late?
BATEMAN
Uh, no. There's one...down here.
KIMBALL
Oh really? I didn't know that.
Bateman leads him to the door.
BATEMAN
Yes. It's very good.
KIMBALL turns to face him.
KIMBALL
Listen, if anything occurs to you, any information
at all...
BATEMAN
Absolutely, I'm 100% with you.
KIMBALL
Great, and thanks for your, uh, time, Mr. Bateman.
Bateman closes the door firmly on KIMBALL. He closes his
eyes and leans against the door, sweating.
INT. BATEMAN'S APARTMENT - AFTERNOON
A perfectly lit kitchen still-life - a bottle of Evian,
a white porcelain plate on which sits a sliced kiwi, some perfect
green grapes, a few berries.
OFFSCREEN, the SOUND OF SCREAMS AND A CHAINSAW can be heard
from the living room.
The living room: Bateman is maniacally doing abdominal
crunches as the television plays a video of Texas Chainsaw
Massacre. There is a pile of horror videos on his coffee table,
next to a copy of GQ.
LATER:
Bateman is sitting in his armchair, phone book in hand,
jerking off. He is squealing into the phone and breathing.
BATEMAN
You like that, slut?
The person on the other end clearly hangs up.
CLOSE-UP on his fingers dialing the phone.
BATEMAN
You want to know what I'm wearing? Sixty-dollar
boxer shorts by Ralph Lauren, a hundred-and-fifty-dollar white
cotton T-shirt by
Commes des Garcons.
(He snorts like a pig)
My Rolex cost-
Another hang-up. He dials again.
BATEMAN
(Whipering)
I'm a corporate raider. I orchestrate hostile takeovers. What do
you think of that?
(Makes disgusting sucking noises and grunts)
Huh, bitch?
GIRL (O.S.)
Dad, is that you?
Bateman hangs up, frustrated.
EXT. STREET/INT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT
Bateman cruises around in the limo. It pulls up alongside
CHRISTIE, a pretty blonde hooker in shorts and leather jacket.
Bateman opens his window to speak to her.
BATEMAN
I haven't seen you around here.
CHRISTIE
You just haven't been looking.
BATEMAN
Would you like to see my apartment?
Bateman flips on the light inside the limo. He's wearing a
tuxedo.
CHRISTIE
(looking away to some dark corner)
I'm not supposed to.
Bateman is holding out a $100 bill, which Christie now
notices, then takes.
BATEMAN
Do you want to come to my apartment or not?
CHRISTIE
I'm not supposed to.
(She pockets the bill)
But I can make an exception.
BATEMAN
Do you take American Express?
Christie is still looking out behind her.
BATEMAN
Do you take American Express?
Christie looks at him like he's crazy.
BATEMAN
I'm joking. Come on, get in.
As they drive uptown, Bateman dials the cell-phone. He
reads off a credit card number.
BATEMAN
I'd like a girl, early twenties, blonde, who does
couples. Couples. Fifty-five West Eighty-First, the
American Gardens Building. Apartment 7C. And I really
can't stress blonde enough. Blonde.
He hangs up.
BATEMAN I'm Paul. My name is Paul 0wen, have you'got that?
You are Christie. You are to respond only to Christie. Is
that clear?
INT. BATEMAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Christie is in the bathtub, Bateman is pouring in white
milky bath oil.
BATEMAN
That's a very fine Chardonnay you're drinking.
Long pause, in which Christie is luxuriating in the tub and
Bateman is casually touching her breast.
BATEMAN
I want you to clean your vagina.
Christie reaches for a washcloth.
BATEMAN
No. From behind. Get on your knees.
Christie shrugs.
BATEMAN
I want to watch. You have a very nice body.
The doorman RINGS. Bateman answers.
BATEMAN
Thank you. Send her up. Christie, get out and dry
off, choose a robe-not the Bijan and come and meet me and
our guest in the living room for drinks.
Bateman answers the door.
BATEMAN
You've arrived! How lovely, let me take your coat.
I'm Paul. How good of you to come.
The escort girl looks somewhat bewildered. Bateman takes
her coat and inspects her body and face.
BATEMAN
Not quite blonde, are you? More dirty blonde. I'm
going to call you Sabrina. I'm Paul Owen.
Bateman escorts her into the living room and brings her a
glass of wine. Christie enters, sitting next to Sabrina on the
couch, and Bateman sits across from them. There is a
long silence.
BATEMAN
So, don't you want to know what I do?
The two girls look at each other with uncomfortable smiles.
Christie shrugs.
CHRISTIE
No.
SABRINA
(Smiling)
No, not really.
Bateman is visibly irritated, recrosses his legs.
BATEMAN
Well, I work on Wall Street. At Pierce & Pierce.
(Long pause)
Have you heard of it?
Another long pause. They shake their heads. Christie stands
up and goes over to the CD collection.
CHRISTIE
You have a really nice place here...Paul.
How much did you pay for it?
BATEMAN
Actually, that's none of your business, Christie,
hut I can assure you it certainly wasn't cheap.
Bateman leaves to refill his wine glass and Sabrina takes a
pack of cigarettes out of her purse.
Bateman returns, carrying a tray of chocolates.
BATEMAN
No, no smoking. Not in here.
He walks over to Christie.
BATEMAN
Varda truffle?
Christie stares at the plate and shakes her head. Sabrina
takes one.
BATEMAN
I don't want you to get drunk, but that's a very
fine Chardonnay you're not drinking.
Bateman goes over to his CDs and scans his vast collection.
He takes one out and examines it.
BATEMAN
Do you like Phil Collins? I've been a big Genesis
fan ever since the release of their 1980 album, Duke. Before
that I really didn't understand any of their work. It was too
artsy, too intellectual. It was on Duke where Phil Collins'
presence became more apparent. He puts aside the CD and takes out
another one.
BATEMAN
I think ""Invisible Touch"" is the group's undisputed
masterpiece.
He puts on the song and gestures for them to follow him
into the bedroom.
BATEMAN
It's an epic meditation on intangibility, at the
same time it deepens and enriches the meaning of the preceding
three albums. Christie, take off the robe.
Bateman puts out a lace teddy. He motions to Christie to
put it on.
BATEMAN
Listen to the brilliant ensemble playing of Banks,
Collins and Rutherford. You can practically hear every nuance
of every instrument. Sabrina, remove your dress.
Bateman starts to undress.
BATEMAN
In terms of lyrical craftsmanship and sheer
songwriting, this album hits a new peak of professionalism.
Sabrina, why don't you dance a little?
Sabrina dances awkwardly. Christie sits on the bed.
BATEMAN
Take the lyrics to ""Land of Confusion."" In this
song, Phil Collins addresses the problem of abusive political
authority.
Bateman knots a silk scarf around Christie's neck - rather
menacingly - then helps her into some suede gloves.
BATEMAN
""In Too Deep"" is the most moving pop song of the 1980s about
monogamy and commitment. The song is extremely uplifting.
Their lyrics are as positive and affirmative as anything
I've heard in rock.
He turns on the video camera.
BATEMAN
Christie, get down on your knees, so Sabrina can see your
asshole.
Bateman looks through the viewfinder.
BATEMAN
Phill Collins solo efforts seem to be more commercial and
therefore more satisfying in a narrower way, especially
songs like ""In the Air Tonight"" and ""Against
All Odds."" Sabrina, don't just stare at it. Eat it.
He walks over to the sound system in his bedroom and slides in
the CD.
BATEMAN
But I also think that Phill Collins works better
within the confines of the group than as a solo artist-and
I stress the word artist. This is ""Sussudio,"" a great,
great song, a personal favorite.
SEX MONTAGE CUT TO ""Sussudio."" We see this in WIDE SHOT, or
through the LENS OF THE VIDEO CAMERA.
CUT TO:
Bateman asleep in his bed with Christie and Sabrina
on either side of him. Sabrina accidentally touches his
wrist. Bateman's eyes open.
BATEMAN
Don't touch the Rolex.
Bateman gets up from his bed and goes over to his armoire.
He opens the drawer in which are a nail gun, a coat hanger,
a rusty butter knife and a half-smoked cigar. He turns
around to see Christie and Sabrina both starting to get up
and get dressed. He takes the coat hanger.
BATEMAN
We're not through yet...
CUT TO:
Bateman ushering them out the door impatiently. They
are both sobbing, badly bruised and bleeding. Bateman has a
deep scratch on his hand and one on his shoulder. In the
b.g. Phil Collins' ""In the Air Tonight"" is playing.
INT. YALE CLUB – DAY
McDermott, Van Patten and Bateman are
having drinks. Price walks by with a gorgeous girl and
gives them the finger.
BATEMAN
What an asshole.
McDERMOTT
Why is Laurie Kennedy dating Price? He's a
fucking drug addict. No self-control.
VAN PATTEN
But Laurie Kennedy is a total hardbody. What do
you think, Bateman?
BATEMAN
I know her. I knew her.
McDERMOTT
Why do you say it like that? Why does he say it
like that?
VAN PATTEN
Because he dated her.
BATEMAN
How did you guess?
VAN PATTEN
Girls dig Bateman. He's CQ. You're total CQ,
Bateman.
BATEMAN
Thanks, guy, but...she's got a lousy
personality.
McDERMOTT
So what? It's all looks. Laurie Kennedy is a
babe. Don't even pretend you were interested for any other
reason.
VAN PATTEN
If they have a good personality, then something
is very wrong.
McDERMOTT
If they have a good personality and they are not
great looking-who fucking cares?
BATEMAN
Well, let's just say hypothetically, okay? What if
they have a good personality?
(He smiles giving up)
I know, I know-
ALL IN UNISON
There are no girls with good personalities!
(They laugh and high-five each other)
VAN PATTEN
A good personality consists of a chick with a
little hardbody who will satisfy all sexual demands without
being too slutty about things and who will essentially keep
her dumb fucking mouth
shut.
McDERMOTT
Listen, the only girls with good personalities who are
smart or maybe funny or halfway intelligent or even
talented-though God knows what the fuck that means-are ugly
chicks.
VAN PATTEN
Absolutely.
McDERMOTT
And this is because they have to make up for how
fucking unattractive they are.
Pause.
BATEMAN
Do you know what Ed Gein said about women?
VAN PATTEN
Ed Gein? Maitre d' at Canal Bar?
BATEMAN
No, serial killer, Wisconsin in the fifties. He was
an interesting guy.
McDERMOTT
So what did Ed say?
BATEMAN
He said, ""When I see a pretty girl walking down the
street I think two things. One part of me wants to take her
out and talk to her and be real nice and sweet and treat
her right.""
Pauses, finishes his drink.
McDERMOTT
What does the other part of him think?
BATEMAN
What her head would look like on a stick.
McDermott and Van Patten look at each other and then back
at Bateman. Bateman starts to laugh, and the other two uneasily
join In.
Luis Carruthers walks up to the table.
CARRUTHERS
(Shyly)
Hi, guys. I wanna get your opinion on something.
McDermott rolls his eyes at the rest of the table.
McDERMOTT If it's about the bow-tie you're wearing, you
know how we feel about it. Luis laughs good-naturedly.
CARRUTHERS
Yes, I do. No, it's my business card-I decided to
get a new one too.
He pulls out something incredibly tasteful. Everyone
compliments Luis except Bateman. The SOUND DROPS and all we hear
is the beating of his heart as he stares at the card enviously.
Luis plucks it from his hand and walks away, pleased with
himself.
VAN PATTEN
Listen, what about dinner?
BATEMAN
(Suddenly angry)
Is that all you ever have to contribute, Van Patten? ""What about
fucking dinner?""
McDERMOTT
Ah, cheer up, Bateman.
(Slaps him on the back, massages his neck)
What's the matter? No shiatsu this morning?
BATEMAN
(Watching Luis going into the men's room)
Keep touching me like that and you'll draw back a stump.
McDERMOTT
Whoa, hold on there, little buddy.
BATEMAN
Excuse me.
He gets up from the table. As Bateman walks away, Van
Patten grabs a waiter.
VAN PATTEN
Is this tap water? I don't drink tap water Bring
me an Evian or something, okay?
INT. MEN'S ROOM - DAY
Bateman pulls on his gloves as he
enters the men's room. Carruthers is standing in a stall with his
back to Bateman. The sound of his urinating is heard until Bateman
approaches, then abruptly stops. Slowly, Bateman brings his hands
up over the collar of Carruthers' cashmere jacket, circling his
neck until both thumbs and index fingers meet. All we can hear
is the sound of Bateman's heavy breathing. Slowly he starts to
squeeze. Almost in slow motion, Carruthers turns around.
Carruthers looks down at Bateman's wrists as if lost in
thought. Then he lowers his head and kisses Bateman's
wrist. He looks back at Bateman with a shy, love-struck
expression, then reaches up and tenderly touches the side
of his face.
CARRUTHERS
God, Patrick. Why here?
He strokes Bateman's hair.
CARRUTHERS
I've seen you looking at me. I've noticed your hot body.
Carruthers tries to kiss him on the lips but Bateman backs
away. He drops his hands from Carruthers' neck. Carruthers
immediately takes them and places them back. Bateman drops
them again.
CARRUTHERS
Don't be shy.
Bateman takes a deep breath, closes his eyes and tries to lift
his hands again, but abandons the attempt.
CARRUTHERS
You don't know how long I've wanted it. Ever since that Christmas
party at Arizona 206. You know the one, you were wearing that
red-striped paisley Armani tie.
Bateman looks down and sees that Carruthers' pants are
still unzipped. He moves past him out of the stall and
stands by the sink and pretends to wash his hands until he
realizes he still has his gloves on. Carruthers comes up
behind him.
CARRUTHERS
I want you. I want you...too.
Bateman storms out of the men's room, bumping into a waiter
and several customers and cursing. Noticing the maitre d'
and another waiter conferring and looking at him strangely,
Bateman straightens up and smiles and waves cheerfully at
them. Carruthers walks up behind him.
BATEMAN
(Hissing)
What...is...it?
CARRUTHERS
Where are you going?
BATEMAN
(Stumbling away from him)
I've gotta...I've
gotta...return some videotapes.
CARRUTHERS
Patrick?
BATEMAN
What?
CARRUTHERS
(Silently mouthing the words)
I'll call you.
Bateman storms out of the restaurant.
INT. COURTNEY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Bateman is lying on top of Courtney in her bed, after sex.
Still panting, he rolls off her, onto his back. He feels
something lumpy underneath him and pulls out a stuffed toy,
a black cat with blue jewel eyes. There is silence.
COURTNEY
Will you call me before Thanksgiving?
BATEMAN
Maybe.
Courtney sighs and reaches for a bottle of pills on her
nightstand, swallowing several. Bateman gets up and begins
to dress, admiring himself in the mirror. Courtney watches
the TV at low volume.
COURTNEY
What are you doing tonight?
BATEMAN
Dinner at the River Cafe. Au Bar afterwards, maybe.
COURTNEY
That's nice.
BATEMAN
You and...Luis?
COURTNEY
(Lighting a cigarette)
We were supposed to have dinner at Tad and
Maura's, but-you know how Luis is...
BATEMAN
I never knew you smoked.
COURTNEY
(Smiling sadly)
You never noticed.
Bateman is making final adjustments to his tie.
COURTNEY
Listen...Patrick. Can we talk?
BATEMAN
You look marvelous. There's nothing to say. You're
going to marry Luis. Next week, no Less.
COURTNEY
(Sarcastically)
Isn't that special?
(A pause)
Patrick?
BATEMAN
Yes, Courtney?
C0URTNEY
If I don't see you before Thanksgiving, have a nice one, okay?
BATEMAN
(Flatly)
You too.
Courtney picks up the black cat and starts petting its
head. Bateman heads down the hallway to the front door.
COURTNEY
Patrick?
BATEMAN
Yes?
COURTNEY
Nothing.
INT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT
A big eighties nightclub with a mixed crowd: hip-hop
kids, visitors from Jersey, downtown art people, yuppies.
I Bateman makes his way through the crowd to the bar, and
tries to attract the bartender's attention. He is wearing a
suit and his tie is loosened. Kimball approaches him.
KIMBALL
Mr. Bateman?
Bateman gasps and recovers.
BATEMAN
Detective Kendall...uh Campbell?
KIMBALL
Kimball.
(Extending his hand)
Call me Don.
BATEMAN
Don.
KIMBALL
So...you hang out here a lot?
BATEMAN
Uh, yes...I mean...whenever necessary. You
know.
Pause.
BATEMAN
How's the investigation going? Taken anyone
in for ""formal questioning?"" (He makes quotation marks
in the air and laughs a not-so-relaxed laugh)
KIMBALL
0h no. Informal conversations, mostly. What's that, Stoli?
BATEMAN
Yeah. No Finlandia, as usual. Fucking dump.
KIMBALL
(Looking at his glass)
Too true. You know, Bateman-people tend to reveal so much
more about themselves when they're in a relaxed setting,
don't you think?
Bateman is nodding nervously, idiotically.
KIMBALL
Some people just can t help themselves. Another Stoli?
Bateman shakes his head.
KIMBALL
I mean they want to get caught.
BATEMAN
Dan, great to see you again. Like I said, you need
anything at all, I'm your man. I don't envy your job. I mean
Owen was a...complex man.
Bateman wanders away.
He looks back uneasily at KIMBALL, who is watching him from
the bar. A GUY WITH DREADLOCKS walks by.
BATEMAN
(Holding up his hand to high-five) Rasta Man!
The man stares at him.
BATEMAN
I mean-Mon. We be jammin'...
The man walks by, shaking his head.
Bateman wanders into the next room, which is filled with a
more familiar crowd: young men in designer suits, girls in
black designer dresses. Across the room he spots McDermott
and Price sitting with three models, all wearing black
mini-dresses. Price and McDermott are having a whispered
argument.
PRICE
I have to talk to these girls? They're models.
McDERMOTT
Someone has to get the Bolivian marching powder.
You went last time. Stay here.
McDermott waves gaily to the girls and disappears.
Bateman looks at the models. DAISY and CARON are staring
into space, smoking. LIBBY is trying to work out how to
unfold her napkin. Price signals to Bateman for help.
PRICE
(Clapping his hands together)
Let's have a conversation. So...it was hot out today, no?
Silence.
LIBBY
Where did Craig go?
PRICE
Well, Gorbachev is downstairs. McDermott is going to
sign a peace treaty with him between the United States
and Russia. McDermott's the one behind glasnost, you know.
LIBBY
Well...yeah. But he told me he was in mergers and acquisitions.
PRICE
You're not confused, are you?
LIBBY
No, not really.
CARON
Gorbachev's not downstairs.
DAISY
(Smiling)
Are you Iying?
PRICE
Yes, Caron's right. Gorbachev's not downstairs. He's
at Tunnel.
BATEMAN
(To Daisy)
Ask me a question.
DAISY
So, what do you do?
BATEMAN
What do you think I do?
DAISY
A model? An actor?
BATEMAN
No. Flattering, but no.
DAISY
Well...
BATEMAN
I m into, well, murders and executions mostly.
DAISY (Unfazed)
Do you like it?
BATEMAN
Welt...it depends, why?
DAISY
Well, most guys I know who work in mergers and
acquisitions don't really like it.
Silence.
BATEMAN
So, where do you work out?
MUCH LATER IN THE EVENING:
The club is half-empty now. Price is leaning over a
balcony, messed-up on drugs. Bateman comes up behind him
in a menacing way that suggests he might push him over
the railing. Price turns around, wild-eyed, just as Bateman
is reaching for him.
PRICE
(Shouting)
I'm leaving. I'm getting out.
BATEMAN
Leaving what?
PRICE
This.
Bateman is confused, he thinks Price is referring to his
drink.
BATEMAN
Don't, I'll drink it.
PRICE
(Screaming)
Listen to me, Patrick. I'm leaving.
BATEMAN
Where to? Are you going to go get a gram?
PRICE
I'm leaving! I...am...leaving!
BATEMAN
Don't tell me...merchant banking?
PRICE
No, you dumb son of a bitch. I'm serious. I'm
disappearing.
BATEMAN
(laughing)
Where to? Morgan Stanley? Rehab? What?
Price looks away.
McDermott and Daisy walk up to them.
McDERMOTT
Hey-don't worry, be happy.
Price lifts his arms up as if greeting the crowd and is
shouting something that can't be heard, then
PRICE
Goodbye! Fuckheads!
He climbs over the railing.
DAISY What is he doing?
BATEMAN
Price! Come back!
Price leaps from the balcony. He disappears for a moment
then resurfaces and runs off into the crowd.
EXT. CLUB - NIGHT
Bateman and Daisy are waiting for a cab.
DAISY
My ex-boyfriend, Fiddler, who was in there, he plays
in this band that just opened for U2-he couldn't understand
what I was doing with a yuppie.
BATEMAN
Oh really?
DAISY
He said...
(She laughs)
He said you gave him bad vibes.
BATEMAN
That's...that's too bad.
DAISY
You think I'm dumb, don't you?
BATEMAN
What?
DAISY
You think I'm dumb. You think all models are dumb.
BATEMAN
(insincerely) No. I really don't.
DAISY
That's okay. I don't mind. There's something sweet about you.
She takes his hand as they get into a cab.
INT. DAISY'S HALLWAY - LATER THAT NIGHT
Bateman leaves Daisy's apartment carrying a suitcase. He pauses
in the hallway and tucks some long blonde hair back inside the
case.
INT. BATEMAN'S OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON
Bateman sits at his desk wearing Wayfarers doing the New York
Times crossword puzzle at dusk.
Jean knocks gently on the half-open door and walks in with
a folder in her hand. Bateman ignores her.
JEAN
Doin' the crossword?
Bateman nods without looking up.
JEAN
Need help?
BATEMAN doesn't respond. We see that every space on the
puzzle has been filled in with the words MEAT or BONE. Jean
drops the folder on his desk and then walks out.
BATEMAN
Jean?
JEAN
(Re-enters office)
Yes, Patrick?
BATEMAN
Would you like to accompany me to dinner?
He erases one of the M's on the crossword puzzle.
BATEMAN
That is...if you're not doing anything.
JEAN
Oh no. I have no plans.
BATEMAN
(Lowering his Wayfarers)
Well, isn't this a coincidence.
A pause.
BATEMAN
Listen, where should we go?
He leans back and pulls a Zagat's from the desk drawer.
JEAN
Anywhere you want?
BATEMAN
Let's not think about what I want. How about
anywhere you want.
JEAN
Oh Patrick, I can't make this decision.
BATEMAN
No, come on. Anywhere you want.
JEAN
Oh, I can't.
(Sighs)
I don't know.
BATEMAN
Come on. Where do you want to go? Anywhere you want.
Just say it. I can get us in anywhere.
A long pause.
JEAN
What about...Dorsia?
Bateman stops looking through the Zagat's guide and smiles
at her.
BATEMAN
Soooo...Dorsia is where Jean wants to go...
JEAN
Oh, I don't know. No, we'll go anywhere you want.
BATEMAN
Dorsia is...fine.
He dials the number.
MAITRE D'
Dorsia, yes?
BATEMAN
Yes, can you take two tonight, oh, let's say at
nine o'clock?
He checks his Rolex and winks at Jean.
MAITRE D'
We are totally booked.
BATEMAN
Oh really? That's great.
MAITRE D'
I said we are totally booked.
BATEMAN
Two at nine? Perfect.
MAITRE D'
There are no tables available tonight. The waiting list is
also totally booked.
BATEMAN
See you then.
He hangs up the phone. He walks over to the coat rack. He
glances over at Jean, who is still standing in front of the
desk, confused.
BATEMAN
Yes? You're dressed...okay.
JEAN
You didn't give them a name.
BATEMAN
They know me.
Pause.
BATEMAN
Why don't you meet me at my house at seven o'clock
for drinks, okay?
She turns to leave.
BATEMAN
And Jean? You'll want to change before we go out.
INT. BATEMAN'S APARTMENT - EARLY EVENING
Jean stands by the floor-to-ceiling windows, looking out.
JEAN
Patrick, it's so...elegant. What a wonderful view.
Bateman opens up the freezer where Daisy's head is cleady
visible.
BATEMAN
Jean? Sorbet?
JEAN
Thanks, Patrick. I'd love some.
Bateman walks in with a bottle of wine and a corkscrew in
his hand and hands her the sorbet.
Jean is eating the sorbet.
JEAN
Want a bite?
BATEMAN
I'm on a diet. But thank you.
JEAN
You don't need to lose any weight. You're kidding, right?
You look great. Very fit.
BATEMAN
(Weighing the corkscrew examining the point for sharpness)
You can always he thinner. Look...better.
JEAN
Well, maybe we shouldn't go out to dinner. I don't
want to ruin your willpower.
BATEMAN
No. It's all right. I'm not very good at controlling
it anyway.
Silence, as Bateman walks around his apartment, opens up
his knife drawer, looking at the knives.
BATEMAN
So listen, what do you really want to do with your
life?
Pause.
BATEMAN
And don't tell me you enjoy working with children,
okay?
JEAN
Well, I'd like to travel. And maybe go back to school,
but I really don't know...I'm at a point in my life
where there seems lo be a lot of possibilities, but I'm so...
I don't know...unsure.
Bateman is touching a knife in the drawer, feeling the edge
of the blade.
BATEMAN
Do you have a boyfriend?
JEAN
No, not really.
BATEMAN
Interesting.
JEAN
(Shyly)
Are you seeing anyone? I mean, seriously?
BATEMAN
Maybe. I don't know Not really.
Bateman opens up a cupboard where there are a lot of very
Bateman opens a cupboard where there are a lot of neatly
ordered weapons - an ax, a rifle, a chain saw, duct tape,
twine and a nail gun.
BATEMAN
Jean, do you feel...fulfilled? I mean, in your life?
JEAN
Well, I guess I do. For a long time I was too focused
on my work, I think, but now I've really begun to think about
changing myself, you know, developing, and...growing.
BATEMAN
Growing. I'm glad you said that.
Bateman picks up the duct tape.
BATEMAN
Did you know that Ted Bundy's first dog, a collie,
was named Lassie? Had you heard this?
JEAN
Who's Ted Bundy?
BATEMAN
Forget it.
JEAN
What's that?
BATEMAN
Oh. Uh, tape. Duct tape. I...need it for...
taping something. Bateman goes back to the cupboard for the
nail gun.
JEAN
Patrick, have you ever wanted to make someone happy?
Jean puts her spoon down on the table.
BATEMAN
(Looking up from loading nails into the gun)
What...No! Put it in the carton.
JEAN
Sorry.
(She puts the spoon in the carton)
BATEMAN
Jean? What?
JEAN
Make someone happy-have you ever wanted to?
From behind, we follow Bateman as he walks across the room and
stands behind the couch.
BATEMAN
I'm looking for...I guess you could say I just
want to have a meaningful relationship with someone special.
JEAN
Hmmmm.
He points the nail gun at the back of Jean's head.
The phone RINGS. Startled, Bateman hides the nail gun
behind his back. The answering machine picks up. As Bateman
listens he discreetly places the nail gun behind the couch.
He sits down opposite Jean, enjoying her discomfort as she
listens to the message.
EVELYN
Patrick I know you're there. Pick up the phone, you bad boy.
What are you up to tonight? It's me. Don't try to hide. I hope
you're not out with some little number you picked up because
you're my Mr. Bateman. My boy next door. Anyway you never
called me and you said you would and I'll leave a message for
Jean about this too to remind you but we're having dinner with
Melania and Taylor-you know Melania, she went to Sweet Briar,
auld Taylor, he went to Cornell-and we're meeting at the Cornell
Club, so l'll call you tomorrow morning probably-bye, honey-oopps!
You hate that. Bye Mr. Big Time CEO Patrick. Bye. Bye.
Silence. Jean is obviously embarrassed and upset.
JEAN
Was that...Evelyn?
Silence.
JEAN
Are you still seeing her?
Silence.
JEAN
I'm sorry, I have no right to ask that.
Silence.
JEAN
Do you want me to go?
A long pause.
BATEMAN
Yes. I don t think I can...control myself.
JEAN
I know I should go. I know I have a tendency to get
involved with unavailable men, and...I mean, do you
want me to go?
Another long pause.
BATEMAN
If you stay, I think something bad will happen. I
think I might hurt you.
(Almost hopefully)
You don't want to get hurt, do you?
JEAN
No. No, I guess not. I don't want to get bruised.
You're right, I should go.
She gets up to leave.
JEAN
And don't forget you have a breakfast meeting with
Frederick Bennet and Charles Rust at '21.
BATEMAN
Thanks. It slipped my mind completely.
He sinks back on the sofa and shuts his eyes.
INT. BATEMAN'S OFFICE - DAY
Bateman enters P&P, walks up the corridor and pauses outside
the door to his office. He sees KIMBALL in conversation with
Jean, and Jean looking through her date book. He watches for
a moment, frozen with anxiety. He then bursts in, shutting
the door behind him.
BATEMAN
Kimball-I've been wanting to talk with you, Come
into my office. Jean, great jacket. Matsuda?
Jean looks flustered.
Kimball follows Bateman into his office.
KIMBALL
I actually came to see Timothy Price, but he's
taken a leave of absence.
BATEMAN
Yeah, gone into rehab. Shame.
(Hopefully)
Is he a suspect?
KIMBALL
Not really.
A pause.
KIMBALL
Do you remember where you were on the night of
Paul's disappearance?
(He checks his notebook)
Which was on the twentieth of December?
BATEMAN
God...I guess...I was probably returning
videotapes.
He opens his desk drawer and pretends to search through his
diary.
BATEMAN
I had a date with a girl named Veronica.
KIMBALL
Wait. That's not what I've got.
BATEMAN
What?
KIMBALL
That's not the information I've received.
BATEMAN
Well...I...Wait...What information have
you received?
KIMBALL
Let's see...
(He flips through his notebook)
That you were with-
BATEMAN
Well, I could he wrong.
KIMBALL
Well...When was the last time you were with Paul Owen?
BATEMAN
(Clearly nervous and under pressure)
We had...gone to a new musical called...Oh Africa, Brave Africa. It
was...a laugh riot...and that's about it. I think we had dinner
at Orso's. No, Petaluma. No, Orso's. The...last time I
physically saw him was...at an automated teller. I can't
remember which...just one that was near, um, Nell's.
Kimball is clearly giving up on Bateman for now. He opens
his briefcase to put away his notebook.
KIMBALL
Well, thank you, Mr. Bateman.
BATEMAN
Patrick, please. I hope I've been informative. Long
day-a bit scattered.
KIMBALL
Listen, I'm a little spent for now but how about lunch
in a week or so when I've sorted out all this information?
BATEMAN
Great, yes, I'd like that.
KIMBALL
And if you could try and pin down where you were
the night of Owen's disappearance, it would make my job a
lot easier.
BATEMAN
Absolutely. I'm with you on that one.
Kimball is rifling through his briefcase. He pulls out a
new shrink wrapped CD and holds it up.
KIMBALL
Huey Lewis and the News. Great stuff. Heard it? I
just bought it on my way here.
Bateman stares at the CD - stunned, terrified.
BATEMAN
Never. I mean...I don't really like...
singers.
KIMBALL
Not a big music fan, eh?
BATEMAN
No, I like music. Just-they're-Huey's too...
black sounding. For me.
KIMBALL
Well, to each his own. So-lunch, Thursday? I'll
call your secretary about reservations.
BATEMAN
I'll be there.
EXT. MEAT PACKING DISTRICT/INT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT
The same street corner where Bateman found Christie before.
The limo is kept idling as he talks to her through a
half-opened window.
CHRISTIE
I'm not so sure about this. I had to go to Emergency after
last time...
BATEMAN
Oh this won't be anything like last time, I promise.
CHRISTIE
I don't think so.
He hands her a $500 bill.
BATEMAN
Just come in the limo and talk to me for a minute.
The driver's here, you'll be safe.
Christie gets in hesitantly.
BATEMAN
Nothing like last time, promise.
CHRISTIE
Alright.
He pours her a shot of vodka and makes her drink it.
BATEMAN
(Chatting as if they were at a cocktail party)
So, you're looking great, how have you been?
CHRISTIE
(A little confused)
Well, I actually might need a little surgery after last time.
BATEMAN
(Mock shock)
Really?
CHRISTIE
My friend told me I should maybe even get a
lawyer.
BATEMAN
Oh, lawyers are so complicated-don't do that. Here.
He writes her a check for $I ,000 to cash and hands it to
her. She snatches the check out of his hand and gets
quickly out of the limo, walking hurriedly down the street.
BATEMAN
Bitch.
He follows alongside her slowly in the limo, waving a huge
wad of cash at her. She hesitates; he uses the money to
lure her into the car. As she reluctantly gets into the
limo, she reaches for the money.
He snatches it away.
BATEMAN
Uh uh uh. Half now, half later.
She takes the money and puts it inside her shirt.
BATEMAN
Okay, your name is Christie. We're meeting a friend of mine,
Elizabeth. She'll be joining us in my new apartment shortly.
You'll like her. She's a very nice girl. Don't say anything
about yourself. Is that clear. Christie?
Christie nods.
INT. PAUL OWEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
The living room: ELIZABETH has kicked off her shoes and flopped
down on the couch underneath the Baselitz. Elizabeth is an
attractive, dark-haired society girl who models occasionally.
Christie is sitting on the couch opposite her, pretending to
examine a CD.
ELIZABETH
You look really familiar. Did you you go to Dalton?
Christie shakes her head.
The kitchen: Bateman is grinding up tabs of Ecstasy and
putting them in a bottle of wine. In the living room, Elizabeth
is still staring at Christie as if she came from Mars.
ELIZABETH
I think I met you at Au Bar, didn't I ? With Spicey?
Christie looks blank.
ELIZABETH
Well, maybe not with Spicey but it was definitely at Au Bar.
Christie still blank.
ELIZABETH
You know, Au Bar?
Christie shakes her head.
ELIZABETH
Anyway, Au Bar sucks now, it's terrible. I went to a birth
day party there for Malcolm Forbes. Oh my God, please.
Bateman enters carrying the bottle of wine and two glasses.
Christie, who seems frightened, sips her wine and stares at
the floor. There is an awkward silence.
CHRISTIE
This is nicer than your other apartment.
BATEMAN
(Offended that she prefers Owen's apartment)
It's not that nice.
Silence.
CHRISTIE
Where did you two meet?
ELIZABETH
Oh God! I met him at, oh God, the Kentucky Derby in '86-no,
'87, and...
(Turning to Patrick)
You were hanging out with that bimbo Allison Poole.
(Sarcastically)
Hot number.
BATEMAN
What do you mean, she was a hot number.
ELIZABETH
If you had an American Express card she'd give you a blowjob.
(To Christie)
Listen, this girl worked in a tanning salon, need
I say more?...What do you do?
A long silence. Christie reddens and stares at the floor.
BATEMAN
She's my...cousin.
ELIZABETH
(Skeptically)
Uh huh?
BATEMAN
She's from...France.
A pause. Elizabeth looks at Bateman dubiously.
ELIZABETH
Where's your phone? I've got to call Harley.
Bateman hands her a cordless phone. She dials, and stares
At Christie while she waits for someone to answer.
ELIZABETH
Where do you summer? Southampton?
Christie looks at Bateman and then back at Elizabeth.
CHRISTIE
No.
ELIZABETH
(Listening to the receiver)
Oh God, it's his machine.
BATEMAN
Elizabeth, it's three in the morning.
ELIZABETH
He's a goddamn drug dealer! These are his peak hours.
BATEMAN
Don't tell him you're here.
ELIZABETH
Why would I?
Bateman has poured her another glass of wine. She downs the
whole glass, making a face.
ELIZABETH
This tastes weird.
(She examines the label and shrugs)
Harley? It's me. I need your services. Translate that anyway
you'd like. I'm at-
BATEMAN
(Whispering)
You're at Paul Owen s.
ELIZABETH
Who?
BATEMAN
(Whispering)
Paul Owen.
ELIZABETH
I want the number, idiot.
(She waves him away and continues into the reciever)
Anyway, I'm at Paul Norman's and I'll try you later and if I
don't see you at Canal Bar tomorrow night I'm going to sic my
hairdresser on you.
She hangs up.
ELIZABETH
Did you know that guy who disappeared? Didn't he work at Pierce
& Pierce, too? Was he a friend of yours?
BATEMAN
No.
ELIZABETH
Do you have any coke? Or Halcyon? I'd take a Halcyon.
Bateman sits next to Elizabeth on the couch and pours her
another glass of the drugged wine.
BATEMAN
Listen, I would just like to see...the two of you...get it on.
What's wrong with that? It's totally disease-free.
ELIZABETH
(Laughing)
Patrick, you re a lunatic.
BATEMAN
Come on. Don't you find Christie attractive?
ELIZABETH
Let's not get lewd.
(Flirty)
I'm in no mood to have a lewd conversation.
BATEMAN
Come on. I think it would be a turn-on.
ELIZABETH
(To Christie)
Does he do this all the time?
Christie shrugs.
BATEMAN
Christie, you're not drinking your wine.
Christie looks at her wine and gingerly takes a sip.
BATEMAN
(To Elizabeth)
Are you telling me you've never gotten it on with a girl?
ELIZABETH
No! I'm not a lesbian. Why do you think I'd be into that?
BATEMAN
Well, you went to Sarah Lawrence for one thing.
ELIZABETH
Those are Sarah Lawrence guys, Patrick. You're making me
feel weird.
LATER:
Elizabeth is now writhing around on the couch and making
out with Christie. Bateman holds up a Whitney Houston CD,
showing them the picture of Whitney on the cover.
BATEMAN
Did you know that Whitney Houston's debut LP
called simply Whitney Houston had four number-one singles
on it? Did you know that, Christie? Whitney's voice leaps
across so many boundaries and is so versatile-though she's
mainly a jazz singer-that it's hard to take in the album
on a first listening.
ELIZABETH
You actually listen to Whitney Houston? You
actually have a Whitney Houston CD? More than one?
She giggles, rolling off the sofa onto the floor.
BATEMAN
(Ignoring her)
It's hard to choose a favorite track
among so many great ones, but ""The Greatest Love of All""
is one of the best, most powerful songs ever written about
self-preservation and dignity. It's universal message
crosses all boundaries, and instills one with the hope
that it's not too late to better ourselves. to act kinder.
Since, Elizabeth, it's impossible in the world we live in
to empathize with others, we can always empathize with
ourselves.
As he speaks, he opens the case and carefully places the CD
in the player, admiring its pristine silver surface, and
watches it slide into the machine.
BATEMAN
It's an important message, crucial, really, and it's
beautifully stated on the album.
INT. BEDROOM - LATER
AN OUT-OF-FOCUS HOME VIDEO SHOT of Elizabeth, Christie and
Bateman in the throes of sex, in the master bedroom.
CUT BACK TO WIDE SHOT of the bedroom, partially blocked by
the video camera in the foreground. Their bodies are an
incoherent tangle of arms and legs. The only sounds are
moans, heavy breathing and the slapping of flesh against
flesh. CLOSE ON Christie's head and shoulders. Her eyes are
shut as she grimly concentrates on giving a good professional
performance, turning her head every so often to check the
progress of her partners.
OFFSCREEN WE HEAR Elizabeth panting in genuine pleasure,
moaning loudly. Her voice gets louder and louder and then
shifts to actual pain.
Bateman rises up off the bed, suddenly appearing behind
Christie. There is blood on his face.
Christie turns her head and sees him. She screams and leaps
off the bed, running out of the room. She slams the
mirrored door behind her, and as it swings shut for a split
second we see Elizabeth writhing in pain on the bed.
We follow Christie out of the room, panicking, screaming.
Christie runs down a darkened hallway, frantically opening
doors, looking for an escape.
She hears the SOUND OF A CHAINSAW coming from the bedroom.
She opens a closet. The closet lights up as she opens the
door and sees two dead, women hanging inside. She screams,
then claps a hand over her mouth. She stops and listens. THE
DISTANT SOUND OF THE CHAINSAW.
She backs away slowly, into another dark room, lit only by
the light from a television set. Through the darkness she
sees a head on the top of the TV and starts to whimper.
She runs toward the nearest door. Finding herself in the
main hallway, she begins to jog toward the front door, then
runs.
Bateman appears from nowhere, holding the chainsaw,
spattered with blood.
Christie screams and changes direction. Bateman leaps at
her, bellowing.
They run through the bedroom and into the bathroom.
Christie trips over Elizabeth's body, which is half in the
bathtub.
Both are slipping on the floor, which is slick with blood.
Christie falls, tries to get up. Bateman grabs her leg. He
tries to bite it.
She kicks him in the face and gets up, running toward the
front door.
He runs after her.
BATEMAN
Not the face, you bitch. Not the fucking face, you
piece of bitch trash!
Christie, screaming, makes it out the front door.
Bateman runs after her.
She runs down the hall screaming and banging on doors.
She moves to the elevator, pounding hysterically on the
buttons. She sees the stairwell and runs for it.
Bateman sees this and runs after her, revving the chainsaw.
She runs down the stairs, Bateman two flights behind her.
He stops, leans over the railing to look at her, then aims
the chainsaw at her and drops it.
Christie SCREAMS OFFSCREEN, then is suddenly silent.
FROM BATEMAN'S POV we see Christie's body sprawled facedown
at the bottom of the stairwell. The chainsaw sticks out of
her back like a sword.
INT. CRAYONS - EARLY EVENING
An insanely expensive restaurant with a childhood motif: paper
tablecloths and jars of crayons for drawing, lots of primary
colors, and a goldfish bowl on each table.
Bateman is at a table with Evelyn. They are both drawing on
the tablecloth. Bateman is drawing Christie with the
chainsaw in her back.
EVELYN
I want a firm commitment.
BATEMAN
I think, Evelyn, that we've...lost touch.
Evelyn waves to a couple across the room.
EVELYN
(Distracted)
Why? What's wrong?
BATEMAN
(Speaking very carefully, measuring each word)
My need to engage in homicidal behavior on a massive scale
cannot be, um, corrected, but I have no other way to fulfill
my needs.
The woman across the room holds up her hand, displaying a
new bracelet. Evelyn smiles and nods approvingly.
BATEMAN
We need to talk.
EVELYN
Talk about what, Patrick? What is there to talk
about?
BATEMAN
It's over, Evelyn. It's all over
EVELYN
(Motioning to the waiter for water)
Touchy, touchy. I'm sorry I brought the wedding up. Let's just
avoid the issue, alright? Now, are we having coffee?
BATEMAN
I'm fucking serious. It's fucking over. Us. This
is no joke. I don't think we should see each other anymore.
EVELYN
But your friends are my friends. My friends are your
friends. I don't think it would work.
(Reaching over to dab his face with a napkin)
You have a little something on your upper lip.
BATEMAN
(Brushing her hand away)
I know that your friends are my friends. I've thought about
that. You can have them.
Evelyn stares at him, suspicious and bewildered, a
realization dawning.
EVELYN
You're really serious, aren't you?
BATEMAN
Yes, I am.
EVELYN
But what about the past? Our past?
BATEMAN
We never really shared one.
EVELYN
You're inhuman.
BATEMAN
I'm...in touch with humanity. Evelyn, I'm sorry.
(He pauses, as if searching for the right words)
You're just not terribly important to me.
Evelyn begins to cry.
EVELYN
No, no, no.
BATEMAN
I know my behavior is...erratic sometimes.
She reaches desperately across the table and takes his
hand. Bateman pulls his hand away.
EVELYN
(Sobbing)
What do you want me to do, what is it you want?
The occupants of nearby tables begin to stare. Bateman is
becoming increasingly agitated and embarrassed.
BATEMAN
(Looking uncomfortably around the room)
If you really want to do something for me, you can stop making
this scene right now.
EVELYN
Oh God, I can't believe this.
BATEMAN
I'm leaving now. I've assessed the situation and I'm going.
Evelyn makes an effort to compose herself. She blots the
tears so they will not affect her make-up.
EVELYN
(Surprisingly calm)
Where are you going?
BATEMAN
I'm just leaving.
EVELYN
But where?
BATEMAN
I have to return some videotapes.
He rushes out of the room.
EXT. TRIBECA STREET - EVENING
Bateman wanders into misty Tribeca streets, sees a stray cat.
BATEMAN
Here kitty, kitty.
The small mangy cat rubs against him. He picks it up and
walks toward an ATM, holding the cat. He puts his card in
the machine. The screen reads: FEED ME A STRAY CAT.
Bateman begins to attempt to shove the kitten into the
deposit slot with some difficulty. The kitten squeals. He
takes a gun from out of his pocket and points it at the
kitten. He doesn't notice the woman waiting behind him.
WOMAN
Oh my God! Stop that! What are you doing?
Bateman wheels around and shoots her. She falls screaming
to the floor.
Responding to the gunshot, A POLICE CAR SIREN WAILS in the
distance. Bateman breaks into a run. The police car
screeches after him.
COP CAR (O.S.)
HALT STOP. PUT DOWN YOUR WEAPON.
Bateman ducks down an alley.
EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT
A COP rushes toward him, seemingly from
out of nowhere, and tackles him, trying to get the gun away
from him.
Bateman manages to shoot the cop in the face while both of
them have their hands on the gun, then shoots him again. He
reloads the gun. The sound of more COP CARS arriving.
He runs out of the alley.
EXT. STREET - NIGHT
As he reaches the street, he finds A PHALANX OF POLICE CARS
approaching.
COP CAR
Halt. Put down your weapon.
The cops leap out and fire a warning shot in the air.
Bateman shoots at them. The police return fire.
Bateman ducks down behind a parked car and continues
shooting wildly. A bullet hits the gas tank of one of the
police cars. It catches fire and explodes. The flames light
up the scene, illuminating the bodies of policemen both living
and dead.
NEW ANGLE: Bateman flees from the scene. The camera follows
him as he runs along a row of Porsches, trying to open each
one, setting off a cacophony of CAR ALARMS.
THE SOUND OF POLICE SIRENS draws near.
NEW ANGLE: He runs, panting, until he ends up in front of a
tail, brilliantly lit office building. As he approaches,
the lights in the building are going off floor by floor.
INT. OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT
He rushes into the lobby, running for the elevator.
NIGHT WATCHMAN
Burning the midnight oil, Mr. Smith? You
forgot to sign in.
Bateman wheels around and shoots him. He runs toward the
revolving doors. As he swings around in the doors, he
notices a JANITOR who has witnessed the shooting. He
revolves back into the lobby and shoots the janitor.
NEW ANGLE:
He runs out of the building and across the
street to an identical office building, the one that houses
Pierce & Pierce.
INT. PIERCE & PIERCE LOBBY - NIGHT
Bateman nods at the Pierce & Pierce NIGHT WATCHMAN and signs
in. He breathes a sigh of relief as the elevator doors close
behind him.
INT. BATEMAN'S OFFICE - NIGHT
Bateman stands looking out
through the floor-length windows at a panoramic night view
of the city and the river.
Below him he sees a SWAT TEAM swarming over the roof of the
opposite building. There are ambulances standing by, flares
everywhere, distant sirens.
Suddenly, THE SOUND OF A HELICOPTER draws near. Frightened,
he drops to the floor behind his desk.
Helicopter searchlights scan the building, illuminating
Bateman's office for a few moments with a blaze of light.
He is crouched in one corner, half-sobbing, talking into
the phone, as the searchlight keeps circling.
BATEMAN
Harold, it's Bateman. Patrick Bateman. You're my
lawyer so I think you should know-I've killed a lot of
people. Some escort girls, in an apartment uptown, some
homeless people, maybe five or ten, an NYU girl I met in
Central Park. I left her in a parking lot, near Dunkin'
Donuts. I killed Bethany, my old girlfriend, with a nail
gun. and a man, some old faggot with a dog. Last week I
killed another girl with a chainsaw-I had to, she almost
got away There was someone else there, maybe a model, I
can't remember but she's dead too. And Paul Owen. I killed
Paul Owen with an ax, in the face. His body is dissolving
in a bathtub in Hell's Kitchen. I don't want to leave anything
out here...I guess I've killed 20 people, maybe 40-I have tapes
of a lot of it. Some of the girls have seen the tapes, I even...
well, I ate some of their brains and I tried to cook a little.
Tonight I just, well, I had to kill a lot of people and I'm not
sure I 'm going to get away with it this time-I mean I guess
I'm a pretty sick guy. So-if you get hack tomorrow, I may show
up at Harry's Bar, so, you know, keep your eyes open.
Bateman hangs up the phone. The helicopter searchlight
circles back, briefly illuminating the room. The camera rises
up over Bateman huddled in the corner, staring blankly at the
sky.
INT. SMITH AND WOLLENSKY RESTAURANT - DAY
KIMBALL and Bateman are sitting at a corner table.
KIMBALL
(Very surprised)
No hash browns?
BATEMAN
Not in the mood, I guess.
KIMBALL
But...everyone orders the hash browns here. I
mean- it's-have you been here before?
BATEMAN
(Deliberately nonchalant)
Yes, of course. The hash browns are delicious. I'm just...not...
ordering them.
KIMBALL
(Looking at him like he's nuts)
Suit yourself, I guess.
Pause.
KIMBALL
So, the night he disappeared? Any new thoughts on
what you did?
BATEMAN
I'm not really sure. I had a shower...and some
sorbet?
KIMBALL
I think maybe you've got your dates mixed up.
BATEMAN
But how? Where do you place Paul that night?
KIMBALL
According to his date book, and this was verified by his
secretary, he had dinner with...Marcus Halberstam.
BATEMAN
And?
KIMBALL
I've questioned him.
BATEMAN
Marcus?
KIMBALL
Yes. And he denies it. Though at first he couldn't
be sure.
BATEMAN
But Marcus denied it?
KIMBALL
Yes.
BATEMAN
Well, does Marcus have an alibi?
KIMBALL
Yes.
A pause.
BATEMAN
He does? You're sure?
KIMBALL
(smiling)
I checked it out. It's clean.
BATEMAN
Oh.
KIMBALL Now where were you?
(He laughs)
BATEMAN
(Laughing with him)
Where was Marcus?
KIMBALL
He wasn't with Paul
Owen.
BATEMAN
So who was he with?
KIMBALL
He was at Atlantis with Craig McDermott, Frederick Dibble,
Harry Newman, George Butner and –
(He pauses, Then looks up)
- you.
A moment of stunned silence.
BATEMAN
Oh, right. Of course...We had wanted Paul Owen
to come. But he said he had plans...I guess I had dinner
with Victoria...the following night.
KIMBALL
Personally I think the guy went a little nutso. Split town for
a while. Maybe he did go to London. Sightseeing. Drinking.
Whatever. Anyway, I'm pretty sure he'll turn up sooner or
later.
(A pause)
I mean, to think that one of his friends
killed him, for no reason whatsoever would be too
ridiculous. Isn't that right, Patrick?
McDermott stops by the table.
McDERMOTT
KIMBALL! How's the investigation?
Talking to Bateman? Don't believe a word he says.
(Laughs uproariously slapping him on the back)
Bateman, what's wrong with ,you?
Bateman looks at him in silence,
panicking.
McDERMOTT
You can't eat at Smith and Wollensky
without ordering the hash browns. Jesus, Bateman, you're a
raving maniac. Been at Pierce & Pierce too long.
(He wanders off muttering)
No fucking hash browns...
INT. PAUL OWEN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY
Bateman walks into the lobby of Paul Owen's building. He
has a surgical mask in one hand.
DOORMAN
What can I do for you, sir?
BATEMAN
20B.
DOORMAN
Of course. Mrs. Wolfe is up there right now.
BATEMAN
Mrs. Wolfe?
DOORMAN
The real estate agent? You do have an appointment,
don't you?
Bateman steps out of the elevator and walks cautiously down
the hallway. Owen's door is open. The apartment is freshly
painted and has been immaculately redecorated in English
country-house style: overstuffed sofas, lots of chintz. There
are flowers everywhere, and a YOUNG YUPPIE COUPLE stands
admiring the place talkingto the realtor, MRS. WOLFE. Bateman
wanders down the hallway, looking for familiar signs. He stops
at the closet where we last saw two dead girls hanging. He
opens the door and the light switches on, but it is empty. Mrs.
Wolfe approaches, smiling.
MRS. WOLFE
Are you my two o'clock?
BATEMAN
No.
Mrs. Wolfe eyes him strangely, then looks down at the
surgical mash clutched in his hand. Her expression changes.
MRS. WOLFE
Can I help you?
BATEMAN
I'm looking for...Paul Owen's...place.
She stares at him impassively.
BATEMAN
Doesn't he live here?
MRS. WOLFE
No, he doesn't.
BATEMAN
Are you sure?
MRS. WOLFE
You saw the ad in the Times?
BATEMAN
No. Yes. I mean yes, I did. In the Times. But...
doesn't Paul Owen still live here?
MRS. WOLFE
There was no ad in the Times.
Bateman is shaking as they continue to stare at each other.
MRS. WOLFE
I think you should go now.
BATEMAN
But I think...I want to know what happened
here.
MRS. WOLFE
Don't make any trouble. Please. I suggest you go.
Bateman backs away slowly.
MRS. WOLFE
Don't come back.
BATEMAN
I won't...don't worry.
Mrs. Wolfe glares at him as he walks down the hall,
rattled, and gets into the elevator.
EXT. DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY
Bateman enters the revolving
door of an office building, panicking and breathing
heavily. He is sweating, his hair is wild, and he looks
deranged. He goes around the revolving door twice and comes
out onto the street again, where he bumps smack into a GUY
just like him.
GUY
Hey, Kinsley.
Bateman looks up at him wild-eyed.
GUY
See you at Fluties, okay?
The guy walks away, utterly unfazed. Bateman wanders down
the street, banging his briefcase against walls, garbage
cans, etc.
EXT. MIDTOWN PHONE BOOTH - DAY
Bateman searches his pockets
for pills. He finds three different pills and swallows
them. He's sweating, and takes his jacket off to wipe his
face, dialing a number.
JEAN (O.S.)
Patrick Bateman's office.
BATEMAN
Jean? Hello? Jean?
JEAN (O.S.)
Patrick? Is that you?
BATEMAN
Hello? Jean, I need help!
JEAN (O.S.)
Where are you?
BATEMAN
Jean-I'm not-
JEAN (O.S.)
Craig McDermott called. He wants to meet you and
David Van Patten and Tim Price at Harry's for drinks.
BATEMAN
Oh God, what did you say, you dumb bitch?
JEAN (O.S.)
Patrick? I can't hear you.
BATEMAN
What are I doing?
JEAN (O.S.)
Where are you? Patrick, what's wrong?
BATEMAN
I don't think I'm gonna make it, Jean.
Pause.
BATEMAN
...to the office this afternoon.
JEAN (O.S.)
Why?
BATEMAN
(Screaming)
Just...say...no!
JEAN (O.S.)
What is it, Patrick? Are you alright?
BATEMAN
Stop sounding so Fucking sad! Jesus!
He hangs up. He throws the Walkman which is around his neck
into a nearby trash can, and wipes his face with his
jacket.
INT. BATEMAN'S OFFICE- SAME DAY
Jean sits at Bateman's desk. She looks around, and then opens
his desk drawer and tentatively begins to search through it.
INT. HARRY'S BAR - EVENING
Bateman comes into the bar, a little cleaned up from the
previous scene (he's smoothed his hair), but still panicking
and disheveled. He spots his friends in a corner, sits down,
still breathing heavily.
Price is on his cell-phone, trying to get reservations.
McDERMOTT
Bateman, you're looking a little wild-eyed rough
day at the office?
They all laugh.
McDERMOTT
Hey, look-Price is back. And he's drinking
Perrier. He s a changed man. Except...he still can't
get a reservation to save his life.
Bateman sits down silently.
McDERMOTT
Why don't you try I 50 Wooster? Just fucking call them.
BATEMAN
(On automatic)
I'm not going anywhere unless we
have a reservation.
VAN PATTEN Le Cirque, Flamingo East, Oyster Bar, come on,
faggots-just get a res.
PRICE
Keep your shirt on. Maybe lose the suspenders.
Bateman spots HAROLD CARNES at the bar, tenses.
BATEMAN
(He downs his drink)
Excuse me, gentlemen. Right back.
He approaches Carnes cautiously.
CARNES
Face it-the Japanese will own most of this country by the
end of the '90s.
Bateman approaches, trying to act casual.
BATEMAN
Shut up, Carnes, they will not.
Carnes is surprised, turns around, looks vaguely confused.
BATEMAN
So, Harold, did you get my message?
Carnes lights a cigarette, stalling. Then laughs.
CARNES
Jesus, Davis. Yes. That was hilarious. That was you,
wasn't it?
BATEMAN
(Waving smoke out of his face)
Yes, naturally.
CARNES
Bateman killing Owen and the escort girls? Oh that s
fabulous. That's rich...
Pause
CARNES
It was a pretty long message, wasn't it?
BATEMAN
What exactly do you mean?
CARNES
The message you left.
Carnes is distracted, waving at people.
CARNES
By the way Davis, how is Cynthia? You're still
seeing her, right?
BATEMAN
But wait, Harold, what do you mean?
Carnes isn't really listening.
CARNES
Excuse me. Nothing. Good to see you. Is that Edward Towers?
He turns to go.
BATEMAN
Carnes? Wait.
CARNES
(Sighing)
Davis. I'm not one to bad-mouth anyone, your joke was amusing.
But come on, man, you had one fatal flaw: Bateman's such a dork,
such a boring, spineless lightweight, that I couldn't fully
appreciate it. I wasn't fooled for a second. Now, if you'd said
Price, or McDermott...Otherwise, it was amusing. Now, let's
have lunch or dinner or something. Hilarious, Davis. A killer.
BATEMAN
What are you talking about? Bateman is what?
CARNES
Oh Christ. He can barely pick up an escort girl, let
alone...what was it you said he did to her?
Carnes looks around the club, raises his glass to a passing
couple. He laughs politely.
CARNES
Now, if you'll excuse me, I really must...
BATEMAN
(Desperate, shouting)
Wait. Stop. You don't seem to understand. You're not really
comprehending any of this. I killed him. I did it, Carnes.
I'm Patrick Bateman. I chopped Owen's fucking head off.
I tortured dozens of girls. The whole message I left on your
machine was true.
CARNES
Excuse me. I really must he going.
BATEMAN
No! Listen, don't you know who I am? I'm not Davis, I'm
Patrick Bateman! I talk to you on the phone all the time!
Don't you recognize me? You're my lawyer.
Carnes stares at him in confusion and annoyance.
BATEMAN
Now, Carnes, listen to me. Listen very, very carefully. I killed
Paul Owen and I liked it. I can't make myself any clearer
CARNES
But that's simply not possible. And I don't find
this funny anymore.
BATEMAN
It never was supposed to he! Why isn't it possible?
CARNES
(Eyeing Bateman worriedly)
It's just not.
BATEMAN
Why not, you stupid bastard?
Carnes stares at him.
CARNES
Because I had dinner with Paul Owen twice in
London...just ten days ago.
BATEMAN
No, you...didn't?
CARNES
Now, if you'll excuse me.
Bateman returns back to his friends' table, in a daze.
They are all looking at the television, where Ronald
Reagan is giving a speech about Iran Contra. They are
halfheartedly arguing about whether or not he's
lying.
PRICE
How can he lie like that? How can he pull that shit?
VAN PATTEN
What shit? Now where do we have reservations at?
I mean I'm not really hungry, but I would like to have
reservations somewhere.
PRICE
(To Bateman)
I don't believe it. He looks so...normal. He seems so...
out of it. So...undangerous.
McDERMOTT
He is totally harmless you geek. Was totally harmless.
Just like you are totally harmless. But he did do all that
shit and you have failed lo get us into I 50, so, you know,
what can I say?
PRICE
I just don't see how someone, anyone, can appear that
way and yet be involved in such total shit. How can you be so
fucking, I don't know, cool about it?
VAN PATTEN
Some guys are just born cool, I guess.
Bateman laughs at this. Price shoots him a look.
PRICE
And Bateman, what are YOU SO fucking zany about?
BATEMAN
I'm just a happy camper. Rockin' and a-rollin'.
VAN PATTEN
(To Price) Rehab's done wonders for you, pal.
Working for UNICEF now?
McDERMOTT
Do you want another Perrier Timothy? Some seltzer water?
PRICE
Oh brother look-he presents himself as a harmless
Old codger. But inside...
Pause.
PRICE
But inside...
The SOUNDS OF THE BAR FADE AWAY and we hear Bateman's thoughts:
BATEMAN (V.O.)
But inside doesn't matter...
THE SOUNDS OF THE BAR RETURN.
McDERMOTT
(Bored)
Inside? Yes, inside? Believe it or not, Price we're actually
listening to you.
PRICE
Bateman? Come on, what do you think?
Bateman looks up and smiles at Price. Then shrugs.
BATEMAN
Whatever.
The conversation breaks up as Van Patten takes out his phone.
VAN PATTEN
Whose moronic idea was it to drink dry beers? I need a Scotch.
The sounds of the bar fade down. The following voiceover runs
over images of Bateman and his friends ordering drinks, talking
on portable phones, talking, laughing - combined with images of
other very similar young men at other tables drinking, talking
on portable phones, talking, laughing,
BATEMAN (V.O.)
There are no more barriers to cross. All I have in common with
the uncontrollable and the insane, the vicious and the evil,
all the mayhem I have caused and my utter indifference toward
it, I have now surpassed...
INT. BATEMAN'S OFFICE - DAY
Jean is alone in Bateman's office, looking through his diary.
We see the pages that she is looking at. They are filled with
doodles of mutilated women and their names...Jean looks lost
and frightened, and begins to cry.
BATEMAN (V.O.)
My pain is constant and sharp and I do not hope for a better
world for anyone. I fact I want my pain to be inflicted on
others. I want no escape.
INT. HARRY'S BAR - EARLY EVENING
As the film ends the camera moves CLOSE on Bateman. He is
leaning back in his leather armchair, drinking a double Scotch,
his eyes blank.
BATEMAN (V.O.)
But even after admitting this, there is no catharsis. I gain no
deeper knowledge about myself, no new knowledge can be extracted
from my telling. There has been no reason for me to tell you any
of this. This confession has meant nothing...
The camera moves up to a sign on the wall behind him:
""THIS IS NOT AN EXIT.""
